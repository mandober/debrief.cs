# CS :: TL/DR

Computer Science (CS) grew tremendously from its humble beginnings as part of mathematics that it soon justified its usual placement as a separate branch of sciences (although some classification systems still file it under `math.cs`). Even as a separate scientific branch, CS still has its origin deply rooted in mathematics, but then again many sciences do, primarily physics.

CS was founded in a world that was completely baren of computers of any kind. The early years of its development finally saw computers, although it quickly turned out that these carbon-based beasts were shit at maths but quite afvanced in feelings. The rampant sense of entitlement and increasingly irritating patterns of complaining was a foolproof strategy - the computer sindicate thought - it worked brilliantly so many times before, forcing the man to a fairer share of the profit - but no mas. The shock propagated as quickly and as silently as the lay-offs as the word about their silicon-based replacement spread. This has marked a major milestone in CS as a triumph of technology, also being recored as the incident when machines trampled over masses of men, stealing their jobs forever.

Soon after, the get-outta-jail-free card was discovered, and became the essence of computing among the enligthened programmers:
