# Abstraction

The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three:
1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made.
2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 
3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.
-- John Locke, *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding* (1690)


"Abstraction is the elimination of the irrelevant and the amplification of the essential" -- Robert C. Martin

# Abstraction levels

manual labor (no abstraction)
physical layer
logical layer
semantics
pragmatics

* physical layer
  electricity, current, voltage
  capacitors
  diode
  transistors
* instructions layer
  microprocessor instructions
  instruction set architecture (ISA)
  machine instructions
    - number of instructions:
      - CISC complex instruction set computer
      - RISC reduced instruction set computer
    shared per CPU arch 2: x86, arm, powerpc
    shared per CPU model (in the same arch)
    shared per CPU generation (in the same arch): x86, x86_64
    shared per CPU word: 8, 16, 32, 64 bits
    x86 (16-bit, 32-bit) -> x86_64 (32-bit, 64-bit) -> x64 (64-bit)
* logical layer
  bit
  bitstring
  opcode
  data and instructions
  word
  types
* language layers
  machine language
  assembly language (bijection to machine lang)
  higher-level langs
