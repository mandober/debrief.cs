## The basic building blocks of computing

If not the most essential ingedient, then surely one of the most fundamental aspects of computing, and probably of the entire computer science as well, is... **abstraction**!

In a less abstract and more information-theoretic sense, the basic building block of computing is a **bit**.






- grouping of which allows the formation of machine primitives
- However, these different primitive types are just different interpretations of the one and the same numeric type
(e.g. signed and unsigned integers, floats, characters, pointers)
All just numbers, which, in turn, are just groups of bits.
