* physical layer
  electricity, current, voltage
  capacitors
  diode
  transistors
* instructions layer
  microprocessor instructions
  instruction set architecture (ISA)
  machine instructions
    - number of instructions:
      - CISC complex instruction set computer
      - RISC reduced instruction set computer
    shared per CPU arch 2: x86, arm, powerpc
    shared per CPU model (in the same arch)
    shared per CPU generation (in the same arch): x86, x86_64
    shared per CPU word: 8, 16, 32, 64 bits
    x86 (16-bit, 32-bit) -> x86_64 (32-bit, 64-bit) -> x64 (64-bit)
* logical layer
