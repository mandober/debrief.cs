What is the most fundamental mathematical object? Something similar to bits in CS, which are the basic building blocks, grouping of which allows the formation of the pretty much standard set of machine primitive types; however, these different primitive types are just different interpretations of the one and the same numeric type (i.e. signed and unsigned integers, floats, characters, pointers, etc.). All just numbers, which, in turn, are just groups of bits.
