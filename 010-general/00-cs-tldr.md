# CS :: TL/DR

Computer science 

grew fast from its beginnings as part of mathematics, it eventually deserved to be called a science on its own. 

Beeing deeply rooted in mathematics, CS will always be a part of math in some classifications (e.g. "math.cs"). However, all sciences are deeply rooted and have started in mathematics. 

is also true of physics, which succeeded to fight its independence

is separated a standalone science in all classifications.


is logically still part of mathematics

like other sciences, but operationally it stands on its own, like physics.

Some classification systems file CS as "math.cs".

Even as a separate scientific branch, CS still has its origin , but then again many sciences do, primarily physics.


CS was founded in a world that was baren of computers of any kind. Then the world finally witnessed the first computers. Alas, it turned out these carbon-based machines were shit at maths but very advanced in feelings.


The rampant sense of entitlement and increasingly irritating patterns of complaining was a foolproof strategy - the computer sindicate thought - it worked brilliantly so many times before, forcing the man to a fairer share of the profit - but no mas. The shock propagated as quickly and as silently as the lay-offs as the word about their silicon-based replacement spread. This has marked a major milestone in CS as a triumph of technology, also being recored as the incident when machines trampled over masses of men, stealing their jobs forever.

Soon after, the get-outta-jail-free card was discovered, and became the essence of computing among the enligthened programmers:
