# Beginnings of CS

Computer Science began as part of mathematics. Modern science classification systems, place CS within mathematics, were it does belong logically. But having grew so much, it is operationally easier to treat it as a standalone science.

Many topics that will fall under CS were initially treated in mathematics. In fact, CS and computers didn't even exist when the topics, that would become a part of computer science, were considered.

The first computers appeared after the WW2, in the late 1940's, but the topics related to computation were taken on much earlier. The interest in these topics peaked in the 1930's with the work of Church and Turing. The Hibert's call to action in the early 1900's had influence as well.
