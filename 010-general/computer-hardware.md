# Computer hardware

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware

Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer such as CPU, cooler and fans, RAM, motherboard, storage devices, PSU, graphics card, case; also external devices (peripherals) like monitor, mouse, keyboard, speakers.

By contrast, software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware is so-termed because it is hard or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software is soft because it is easy to change.

Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or instruction. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system, although other systems exist with only hardware.
