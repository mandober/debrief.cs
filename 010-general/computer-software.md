# Computer software

Software consists of computer programs that instruct the execution of a computer.

Building on previous innovations in mathematics and technology, software was created for the *programmable* digital computers that emerged in the late 1940s and was necessary to realize their usefulness.

The *first software* was tied closely to the underlying computer hardware, but over time, the lower layers of the system have become more standardized, and software has become increasingly portable between different systems and *abstracted* from the underlying machine code. 

*Operating systems* manage the hardware resources and mediate between different applications that accomplish tasks for the user. 

*Programming languages* are the format in which software is written, and must be both human-readable and capable of being translated into unambiguous instructions for computer hardware. 

*Compilers* or *interpreters* are needed to link a program with other code that it relies on and convert the software into machine code that can be executed on the hardware. 

*Programs* are combined with each other and with external input to be capable of accomplishing a complex task.

*Software development*'s central task is programming and maintaining a project's source code, but the term also covers conceiving the project, evaluating its feasibility, analyzing the business requirements, software design, and release.

*Software quality assurance*, including code review and testing, is an essential part of the process, as is delivering quality code lowers the cost of reliability failures, cyberattacks enabled by security vulnerabilities, and maintenance costs.

*Software maintenance* typically consumes 75 percent or more of the software's lifetime engineering budget. 

*Source code* is protected by copyright law, which vests the owner with the exclusive right to copy the code.

Software has become ubiquitous in everyday life in developed countries. In many cases, software augments the functionality of pre-existing technologies, but it has also enabled the creation of entirely new technologies such as the Internet, video games, social media, mobile phones, and GPS.
