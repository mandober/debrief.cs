# Hardware without software

Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer such as CPU, cooler and fans, RAM, motherboard, storage devices, PSU, graphics card, case; also external devices (peripherals) like monitor, mouse, keyboard, speakers.

By contrast, software includes user data that can be stored on hardware devices; it also includes instructions that are used to run hardware.

The term "hardware" implies something rigid, that resists to changes, whereas "software" implies ease of change. In time, the term "ware", as a suffix started to participate in many neologisms like firmware, trialware, freeware, bloatware, waporware, etc.

Hardware and software have some similarities with the mind and body problem. Hardware is instructed by the software. Software is stored on hardware. 

A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system, although other systems exist with only hardware.

A *programmable computer* needs both software and hardware to function. The essential property of computers is *programmability* - without it, a machine is not a computer.

- programmable machine = computer
- non-programmable machine â‰  computer

However, there are many *non-programmable machines* that are still useful, despite the lack of software. These machines show that hardware can in fact function without software in some circumstances. On the other hand, software always needs hardware - there cannot be software on its own. 

Although these non-programmable machines are not computers, they may be looked at as being "stuck computers", the computers stuck to forever repeat the same set of behaviors.

For example, a washing machines cannot be programmed (in the strict sense), so it is not a computer; which is ok, since it never had such ambitions. A washing machines doesn't need to carry out any random action - it only needs to carry out one action from a set of several well-defined, fixed, and completely deterministic actions. 

When this is the case, the logic that software provides may be *burnt onto* the hardware. So software gets realized in hardware as hardware (using e.g. switches, dials, and what not; logical gates even).

This is possible when the set of all the actions a machine is to perform is fixed, deterministic and free of dependencies. If-then-else construct is realizable in hardware, but the complexity tends to multiply quickly, eventually making the whole endeavour unwieldy.

So the control of tosters, washing machines, vacuums, irons, refrigerators, and similar house appliances may be done without having proper software onboard. Anything more complex does required it. For example, semi-modern TV sets, cars, music players are complex enough that a proper computer is warrented to control them. In fact, today, putting a computer in a device is affordable and probably easier then burning in the controlling logic.
