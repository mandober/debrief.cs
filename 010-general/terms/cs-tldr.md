# CS :: TL/DR

Computer Science (CS) grew fast from its beginnings as part of mathematics, eventually deserving to be called a science on its own. Even more then other sciences, CS will always have a strong connection to mathematics, and often included in various classifications as part of math (e.g. "math.cs").

Curiously, CS was founded at the time when no computers existed. On the other hand, like they say, CS is as much about computers as astronomy is about telescopes. However, like astronomy, it can only do so much without its principle instrument.

The Hibert's address in the early 1900's was a call to action that inpired new reasearch, among which were unresolved problems related to computation. The interest in topics about computation peaked in the 1930's with the work of Church and Turing.

Nevertheless, the principle theorems of CS, like the *decision problem*, was already established before the first computers appeared. The proof of the decision problem in the negative will forever bring trouble to computation, most often realized as infinite loops. The decision problem will forever bound computation as it shows that computers (once invented) will not be able to do everything; there will always be some problems out of their reach, which they cannot solve no matter how advance they become.

The first computers finally appeared after the WW2, in the late 1940's.
