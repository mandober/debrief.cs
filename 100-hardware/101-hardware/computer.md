# Computer

A **computer** is a device that carries out arithmetic and logical operations, provided as a sequence of instructions called computer programs.

**Computer programming** is authoring of computer programs to be executed on a computer in order to perform a specific task.

Fundamental *computer components*
1. CPU
2. Memory
3. IO
4. Bus
- Memory and bus organization
- Memory and bus have big impact on program and CPU performance
- Memory performance characteristics
- data locality
- cache operation


*Computer architecture* is the basic operational design of a computer system. John von Neumann, a pioneer in computer design, is given credit for the principal computer architecture in use today.


Von Neumann architecture has 3 major components:
1. CPU - Central Processing Unit
2. Memory
3. I/O - Input/Output




Computers consist of the 3 fundamental parts:
1. Central processing unit for data processing
2. Memory for storing data to be processed
3. I/O devices for providing communication facilities


Computer components

A decent computer in 2018 consists of multiple cores (16), housing 3 levels of cache and a multitude of registers implemented as SRAM memory. DDR4 DRAM (16 GB) is used as the main memory. SSD for secondary memory, HDD for tertiary memory storage. Modern peripherals include an LCD monitor for display, a mouse and keyboard for user interaction and a LAN and Wi-Fi devices for networking.

Whatever the system's specs, computer buses move data between all of these devices.
