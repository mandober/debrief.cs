# Computer Architecture

Computer architecture is the basic operational design of a computer system. The goal of computer architecture is to design a computer by maximizing its performance and reliability, while minimizing its costs and power consumption. To achieve this task, a computer architecture describes the functionality, organization and implementation of a computer system, especially considering instruction set design, logic design, optimization, packaging.
