## Hard Disk Drive
Hard Disk Drive (HDD, hard disk, hard drive, fixed disk) is an electro-mechanical data storage device that uses magnetic storage to store and retrieve digital information using one or more, rigid, rapidly rotating, disks (platters) coated with magnetic material.

Further inequivalent terms used to describe various hard disk drives include disk drive, disk file, direct access storage device (DASD), CKD disk, and Winchester disk drive (after the IBM 3340). The term "DASD" includes other devices beside disks.

The *platters* are paired with *magnetic heads*, usually arranged on a moving *actuator* arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces.
