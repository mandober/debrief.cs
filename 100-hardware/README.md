# CS :: Hardware

The Hardware section is about the *physical substrate of computation*, describing physical computer components like the motherboard, CPU, memory, storage, peripherals, and related devices. As it is difficult to cleanly separate hardware from software, there may be some overlap between this and other sections. Everything pertaining to just hardware should be in here, but the topics where the software is also involved may be here or in another section in the "cs" debrief.

pile it up, extract related clusters later

e.g. BIOS, memory management and virtual memory, being a joint effort by both hardware (MMU, TLB) and software (page tables) has no easy home.
