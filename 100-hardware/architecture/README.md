- microprocessor design
- Microarchitecture (Î¼arch, Computer Organization): the way a given Instruction Set Architecture is implemented in a particular processor.
- A given ISA may be implemented with different microarchitectures
- *Computer architecture* is the combination of microarchitecture and instruction set architecture.
