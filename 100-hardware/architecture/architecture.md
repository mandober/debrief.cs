# Architecture

Complex systems, like computers and even the universe itself, seem to be determined by a finite - and relatively small at that - set of factors. For our universe, the actual values of these factors comprise the set of the so-called *fundamental constants*, with each dialed to an optimal value (obviously), so that their interplay gives a satisfactory outcome, resulting in a universe that is not only stable but gives rise to all sorts of emerging phenomena, like life and intelligence. Setting even one of these constants differently would probably bring about a very different kind of universe. Maybe the force of gravity would be just enough off to make matter impossible to form.

In a lot less details and hazard, the situation is similar with computer systems, even though all the adjustables are man made. In this view, what would be the fundamental constants of a computer system? One of them is surely bitness, but even before that the issue of the basic unit has to be established. Computers today use *bit* as the basic unit of information, with it having only two distinctive states, on and off, which, thereby, make it a *binary system*. However, binary may not be the most optimal system when compared to *balanced ternary*, which was used in some early computers.









Computer architecture may also be interpreted as an umbrella term for all low-level things concerning a computer system.

the name for the fundamental properties of a computer system. 




Similarly to physical systems including the universe itself 

which is determined by the concrete values that a fundamental set of constants take - so is a computer system characterized by the values of a relatively small set of factors. The speed of light is one of the fundamental constants, and it having a different value would render manifest a different universe. The actual realization of a complex systems is determined by the values a fundamental but finite set of factors take on. Each factor has a "dial" with a certain sensible range, and the interplay of all the dials causes the properties a system will have.
