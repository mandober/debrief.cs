## Raptor Lake - gen 13&14
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor_Lake

Successor: Arrow Lake (desktop), Meteor Lake (mobile)

Raptor Lake is Intel's codename for the **13th and 14th generations** of Intel Core processors based on a hybrid architecture, utilizing *Raptor Cove* performance cores and *Gracemont* efficiency cores.

Like Alder Lake, Raptor Lake is fabricated using Intel's *Intel 7 process*.

Raptor Lake features up to *24 cores* (8 performance cores plus 16 efficiency cores) and 32 threads and is socket compatible with Alder Lake systems (LGA 1700, BGA1744, BGA1964).

Like earlier generations, Raptor Lake processors also need accompanying chipsets.

Raptor Lake launched on October 20, *2022*. On January 3, 2023 at CES 2023, Intel announced additional desktop CPUs and mobile CPUs. The **14th generation** was launched on *October 17, 2023*.

Intel spokesman revealed that Raptor Lake was created to benefit from process improvements before Meteor Lake arrives since the next microarchitecture was likely to be delayed.

Raptor Lake competes with the *AMD Ryzen 7000* series that was launched about one month earlier on September 27, 2022.

The 14th-generation *Raptor Lake-Refresh* is the last processor family to use the old Core i branding scheme.




## Alder Lake - gen 12
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alder_Lake

Alder Lake is Intel's codename for the **12th generation** of Intel Core processors based on a hybrid architecture utilizing *Golden Cove performance cores* and *Gracemont efficient cores*. 

It is fabricated using Intel's Intel 7 process, previously referred to as *Intel 10 nm Enhanced SuperFin* (10ESF). The 10ESF has a 10%-15% boost in performance over the 10SF used in the mobile Tiger Lake processors.

Intel officially announced 12th Gen Intel Core CPUs on October 27, 2021, mobile CPUs and non-K series desktop CPUs on January 4, 2022, Alder Lake-P and -U series on February 23, 2022, and Alder Lake-HX series on May 10, 2022


## Rocket Lake - 11 gen
Rocket Lake is Intel's codename for its **11th generation** Core microprocessors. Released on March 30, *2021*, it is based on the new *Cypress Cove microarchitecture*, a variant of Sunny Cove (used by Intel's Ice Lake mobile processors) backported to Intel's 14 nm process node. Rocket Lake cores contain significantly more transistors than Skylake-derived Comet Lake cores.

Rocket Lake features the same *LGA 1200* socket and *400-series chipset* compatibility as Comet Lake (except H410 and B460 chipsets). It is accompanied by new *500-series chipsets* as well. Rocket Lake has *up to 8 cores*, down from 10 cores for Comet Lake. It features *Intel Xe graphics*, and *PCIe 4.0* support. Only a single M.2 drive is supported in PCIe 4.0 mode, while all the rest are wired via PCIe 3.0.

Intel officially launched the Rocket Lake desktop family on March 16, *2021*, with sales commencing on March 30. The 11th generation Core i3, as well as Rocket Lake-based Pentium Gold and Celeron CPUs were not included along with the higher-end models; instead, Intel launched refreshed models for Comet Lake Core i3 and Pentium Gold CPUs. These processors have the same characteristics as their original parts, albeit with a 100 MHz higher frequency and the last digit of their model numbers changing from zero to five. Intel also released *Tiger Lake* processors as part of the 11th generation lineup in the desktop/NUC and tablet market. Such processors have the new B suffix in the model names.

## Tiger Lake - 11 gen
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Lake

Tiger Lake is Intel's codename for the **11th generation** Intel Core mobile processors based on the *Willow Cove Core microarchitecture*, manufactured using Intel's third-generation *10 nm* process node known as 10SF ("10 nm SuperFin"). Tiger Lake replaces the Ice Lake family of mobile processors, representing an optimization step in Intel's process-architecture-optimization model.

Tiger Lake processors launched on September 2, *2020*, are part of the Tiger Lake-U family and include dual-core and quad-core 9 W (7-15 W) TDP and 15 W (12-28 W) TDP models. They power 2020 "Project Athena" laptops. The quad-core 96 EU die measures 13.6 × 10.7 mm (146.1 mm2), which is 19.2% wider than the 11.4 × 10.7 mm (122.5 mm2) quad-core 64 EU Ice Lake die. The 8-core 32 EU die used in Tiger Lake-H is around 190 mm2. According to Yehuda Nissan and his team, the architecture is named after a lake across Puget Sound, Washington from Seattle. Laptops based on Tiger Lake started to sell in October 2020.

The Tiger Lake-H35 processors were launched on January 11, 2021. These quad-core processors are designed for "ultraportable gaming" laptops with 28-35 W TDP. Intel officially launched the 11th generation Intel Core-H series on May 11, 2021 and announced the 11th generation Intel Core Tiger Lake Refresh series (1195G7 and 1155G7) on May 30, 2021.

## Ice Lake - 10 gen

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Lake_(microprocessor)

Ice Lake is Intel's codename for the **10th generation** *Intel Core mobile* and *3rd generation Xeon Scalable server processors* based on the *Sunny Cove* microarchitecture. Ice Lake represents an architecture step in Intel's process-architecture-optimization model.

Produced on the second generation of Intel's 10 nm process, *10 nm+*, Ice Lake is Intel's second microarchitecture to be manufactured on the 10 nm process, following the limited launch of Cannon Lake in 2018.

However, Intel altered their naming scheme in 2020 for the 10 nm process. In this new naming scheme, Ice Lake's manufacturing process is called simply 10 nm, without any appended pluses.

Ice Lake CPUs are sold together with the 14 nm Comet Lake CPUs as Intel's *"10th Generation Core"* product family. There are no Ice Lake desktop or high-power mobile processors; *Comet Lake* fulfills this role. Sunny Cove-based Xeon Scalable CPUs (codenamed "Ice Lake-SP") officially launched on April 6, 2021. Intel officially launched Xeon W-3300 series workstation processors on July 29, 2021.

Ice Lake's direct successor in mobile is *Tiger Lake*, a third-generation 10 nm processor family using the new *Willow Cove microarchitecture* and integrated graphics based on the new Intel Xe microarchitecture. Ice Lake-SP will be succeeded by *Sapphire Rapids*, powered by *Golden Cove cores*. Several mobile Ice Lake CPUs were discontinued on July 7, 2021.

## Willow Cove
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow_Cove

Willow Cove is a codename for a CPU microarchitecture developed by Intel and released in September 2020. Willow Cove is the successor to the Sunny Cove microarchitecture, and is fabricated using Intel's enhanced 10 nm process node called 10 nm SuperFin (10SF).[1] The microarchitecture powers 11th-generation Intel Core mobile processors (codenamed "Tiger Lake").[1][2]

The Willow Cove microarchitecture was succeeded by Golden Cove.

## Cannon Lake
Cannon Lake (formerly Skymont) is Intel's codename for the *10 nm* die shrink of the Kaby Lake microarchitecture. As a die shrink, Cannon Lake is a new process in Intel's process-architecture-optimization execution plan as the next step in semiconductor fabrication. Cannon Lake CPUs are the first mainstream CPUs to include the AVX-512 instruction set. Prior to Cannon Lake's launch, Intel launched another 14 nm process refinement with the codename *Coffee Lake*. The successor of Cannon Lake is *Ice Lake*, powered by the *Sunny Cove* microarchitecture, which represents the architecture phase in the process-architecture-optimization model.

## Golden Cove
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Cove

Golden Cove is a codename for a CPU microarchitecture developed by Intel and released in November 2021. It succeeds four microarchitectures: Sunny Cove, Skylake, Willow Cove, and Cypress Cove.[2][3][4] It is fabricated using Intel's Intel 7 process node, previously referred to as 10 nm Enhanced SuperFin (10ESF).

The microarchitecture is used in the high-performance cores (P-core) of the 12th-generation Intel Core processors (codenamed "Alder Lake") and fourth-generation Xeon Scalable server processors (codenamed "Sapphire Rapids").

## Sunny Cove
Sunny Cove is a codename for a CPU microarchitecture developed by Intel, first released in September 2019. It succeeds the *Palm Cove microarchitecture* and is fabricated using Intel's *10 nm* process node. The microarchitecture is implemented in *10th-generation* Intel Core processors for mobile (codenamed Ice Lake) and third generation Xeon scalable server processors (codenamed Ice Lake-SP). 10th-generation Intel Core mobile processors were released in September 2019, while the Xeon server processors were released on April 6, *2021*.

There are no desktop products featuring Sunny Cove. However, a variant named Cypress Cove is used for the 11th-generation Intel Core desktop processors (codenamed Rocket Lake). Cypress Cove is a version of the Sunny Cove microarchitecture backported to Intel's 14 nm process node.

The direct successor to the Sunny Cove microarchitecture is the Willow Cove microarchitecture, which powers the 11th-generation Intel Core mobile processors.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_Lake

Coffee Lake is Intel's codename for its **8th generation** Core microprocessor family, announced on September 25, *2017*. It is manufactured using Intel's second *14 nm* process node refinement. Desktop Coffee Lake processors introduced i5 and i7 CPUs featuring 6 cores (along with hyper-threading in the case of the latter) and Core i3 CPUs with four cores and no hyperthreading.

On October 8, 2018, Intel announced what it branded its **9th generation** of Core processors, the *Coffee Lake Refresh family*. To avoid running into thermal problems at high clock speeds, Intel soldered the integrated heat spreader (IHS) to the CPU die instead of using thermal paste as on the Coffee Lake processors. The generation was defined by another increase of core counts.

Coffee Lake is used with the *300-series chipset*, and officially does not work with the 100- and 200-series chipset motherboards. Although desktop Coffee Lake processors use the same physical *LGA 1151 socket* as Skylake and Kaby Lake, the pinout is electrically incompatible with these older processors and motherboards.

On April 2, 2018, Intel released additional desktop Core i3, i5, i7, Pentium Gold, Celeron CPUs, the first 6-core Core i7 and i9 mobile CPUs, hyper-threaded 4-core Core i5 mobile CPUs, and the first Coffee Lake ultra-power CPUs with *Intel Iris Plus graphics*.

On June 8, 2018, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Intel 8086 CPU architecture, Intel released the i7-8086K as a limited edition CPU, a renumbered and slightly higher clocked batch of the i7-8700K dies.

## Kaby Lake - gen 7
Kaby Lake is Intel's codename for its **7th generation** Core microprocessor family announced on August 30, *2016*. Like the preceding Skylake, Kaby Lake is produced using a *14 nm* manufacturing process technology. Breaking with Intel's previous "tick-tock" manufacturing and design model, Kaby Lake represents the optimized step of the newer process-architecture-optimization model.

## Skylake - gen6
Skylake is Intel's codename for its **6th generation** Core microprocessor family that was launched on August 5, 2015, succeeding the Broadwell microarchitecture. Skylake is a microarchitecture redesign using the same 14 nm manufacturing process technology as its predecessor, serving as a tock in Intel's tick-tock manufacturing and design model. According to Intel, the redesign brings greater CPU and GPU performance and reduced power consumption. Skylake CPUs share their microarchitecture with Kaby Lake, Coffee Lake, Cannon Lake, Whiskey Lake, and Comet Lake

## Broadwell - gen5
Broadwell is the **5th generation** of the Intel Core processor. It is Intel's codename for the *14 nm* die shrink of its Haswell microarchitecture. It is a "tick" in Intel's tick-tock principle as the next step in semiconductor fabrication. Like some of the previous tick-tock iterations, Broadwell did not completely replace the full range of CPUs from the previous microarchitecture (Haswell), as there were no low-end desktop CPUs based on Broadwell. Some of the processors based on the Broadwell microarchitecture are marketed as "5th-generation Core" i3, i5 and i7 processors. This moniker is however not used for marketing of the Broadwell-based Celeron, Pentium or Xeon chips. This microarchitecture also introduced the *Core M processor* branding. Broadwell's H and C variants are used in conjunction with *Intel 9 Series chipsets (Z97, H97 and HM97)*, in addition to retaining backward compatibility with some of the Intel 8 Series chipsets.

## Haswell - gen4
Haswell is the codename for a processor microarchitecture developed by Intel as the **4th generation** Core successor to the *Ivy Bridge* (which is a die shrink/tick of the *Sandy Bridge* microarchitecture). A working Haswell chip was demonstrated at the 2011 Intel Developer Forum. With Haswell, which uses a *22 nm* process, Intel also introduced low-power processors designed for convertible or "hybrid" ultrabooks, designated by the "U" suffix. Haswell CPUs are used in conjunction with the Intel 8 Series chipsets, Intel 9 Series chipsets, and Intel C220 series chipsets. At least one Haswell-based processor was still being sold in 2022 - the Pentium G3420. Windows 7 through Windows 10 were released for the Haswell microarchitecture.

## Ivy Bridge - gen3
Ivy Bridge is the codename for Intel's *22 nm* microarchitecture used in the **3rd generation** of the Intel Core processors (Core i7, i5, i3). Ivy Bridge is a die shrink to 22 nm process based on FinFET ("3D") Tri-Gate transistors, from the former generation's 32 nm Sandy Bridge microarchitecture (aka the tick-tock model). The name is also applied more broadly to the Xeon and Core i7 Ivy Bridge-E series of processors released in 2013. Ivy Bridge processors are backward compatible with the Sandy Bridge platform, but such systems might require a firmware update (vendor specific). In 2011, Intel released the 7-series Panther Point chipsets with integrated USB 3.0 and SATA 3.0 to complement Ivy Bridge. Volume production of Ivy Bridge chips began in the third quarter of 2011. Quad-core and dual-core-mobile models launched on April 29, 2012 and May 31, 2012 respectively. Core i3 desktop processors, as well as the first 22 nm Pentium, were announced and available the first week of September 2012.

## Sandy Bridge - gen 2
Sandy Bridge is the codename for Intel's *32 nm* microarchitecture used in the **2nd generation** of the Intel Core processors (Core i7, i5, i3). The Sandy Bridge microarchitecture is the successor to *Nehalem* and *Westmere* microarchitecture. Intel demonstrated a Sandy Bridge processor in 2009, and released first products based on the architecture in January *2011* under the Core brand. Sandy Bridge is manufactured in the 32 nm process and has a soldered contact with the die and IHS (*Integrated Heat Spreader*), while Intel's subsequent generation Ivy Bridge uses a 22 nm die shrink and a TIM (Thermal Interface Material) between the die and the IHS.

## Nehalem - gen 1
Nehalem is the codename for Intel's *45 nm* microarchitecture released in November *2008*. It was used in the **1st generation** of the Intel Core (i5 and i7 processors), and succeeds the older *Core* microarchitecture used on `Core 2` processors. The term "Nehalem" comes from the Nehalem River. Nehalem is built on the 45 nm process, is able to run at higher clock speeds, and is more energy-efficient than Penryn microprocessors. *Hyper-threading* is reintroduced, along with a reduction in L2 cache size, as well as an enlarged L3 cache that is shared among all cores. Nehalem is an architecture that differs radically from *NetBurst*, while retaining some of the latter's minor features. Nehalem later received a die-shrink to 32 nm with *Westmere*, and was fully succeeded by "second-generation" Sandy Bridge in January 2011.

## Westmere
Westmere (formerly Nehalem-C) is the code name given to the *32 nm* die shrink of Nehalem. While sharing the same CPU sockets, Westmere included *Intel HD Graphics*, while Nehalem did not. The first Westmere-based processors were launched on January 7, *2010*, by Intel Corporation. The Westmere architecture has been available under the Intel brands of Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, Pentium, Celeron and Xeon.
