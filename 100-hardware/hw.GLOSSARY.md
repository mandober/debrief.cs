## Byte addressing
In computer architecture, byte addressing means that memory addresses uniquely identify bytes, as opposed to words.

## Computer architecture
Computer architecture is the combination of microarchitecture and instruction set architecture.

## Computer organization
see Microarchitecture

## Word addressing
In computer architecture, word addressing means that memory addresses uniquely identify words of memory, as opposed to bytes.

## Microarchitecture
Microarchitecture (Î¼arch), also called computer organization, is a way an instruction set architecture (ISA) is implemented in a particular processor. A given ISA may be implemented with different microarchitectures; implementations may vary due to different design goals or technological shifts.
