**Wireless USB** (Universal Serial Bus) is a short-range, high-bandwidth wireless radio communication protocol created by the Wireless USB Promoter Group, which is intended to increase the availability of general USB-based technologies. It is unrelated to Wi-Fi and different from the Cypress Wireless USB offerings. It was maintained by the *WiMedia Alliance* which ceased operations in 2009. Wireless USB is sometimes abbreviated as *WUSB*, although the USB Implementers Forum discouraged this practice and instead prefers to call the technology Certified Wireless USB to distinguish it from the competing UWB standard.

**Passive optical network (PON)** is a *fiber-optic* telecommunications network that uses only unpowered devices to carry signals, as opposed to electronic equipment. In practice, PONs are typically used for the last mile between an ISP and their customers. In this use, a PON has a point-to-multipoint topology in which an ISP uses a single device to serve many end-user sites using a system such as 10G-PON or GPON.

**10G-PON** (also known as XG-PON or G.987) is a 2010 computer networking standard for data links, capable of delivering shared Internet access rates up to 10 Gbit/s (gigabits per second) over dark fiber. This is the ITU-T's next-generation standard following on from GPON or gigabit-capable PON.

**Gigabit-capable passive optical network (GPON)** is implemented according to the *ITU-T G.984* series of standards. Commonly used to implement the link to the customer (the last mile) of *fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP)* services.

**Fiber to the x (FTTX)**, or fiber in the loop, is a generic term for any *broadband network architecture* using *optical fiber* to provide all or part of the local loop used for *last mile telecommunications*. As *fiber optic cables* are able to carry much more data than *copper cables*, especially over long distances, copper telephone networks built in the 20th century are being replaced by fiber.

**IEEE 1901** is a standard for high-speed (up to 500 Mbit/s at the physical layer) communication devices via electric power lines, often called *Broadband Over Power Lines (Bpl)*. The standard uses transmission frequencies below 100 MHz. This standard is usable by all classes of BPL devices, including BPL devices used for the connection. To handle multiple devices attempting to use the line at the same time, IEEE 1901 supports TDMA, but CSMA/CA (also used in WiFi) is most commonly implemented by devices sold.

**Nessum, previously High Definition Power Line Communication (HD-PLC)** is a communication technology standardized by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). It is standardized as IEEE 1901-2020. The standard is to be used to communicate data over wired and wireless media using high frequencies between ~500kHz and ~56 MHz bands. The Nessum Alliance is the certifying body for compatibility between Nessum-based communication devices.

**HomePlug** is the family name for various power line communications specifications under the HomePlug designation, each with unique capabilities and compatibility with other HomePlug specifications.

**HomePNA Alliance** (formerly the **Home Phoneline Networking Alliance**, also known as HPNA) is an incorporated non-profit industry association of companies that develops and standardizes technology for home networking over the existing *coaxial cables and telephone wiring* within homes, so new wires do not need to be installed. HomePNA creates industry specifications which it then standardizes under the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standards body.

**Gigabit Home Networking (G.hn)** is a specification for wired home networking that supports speeds up to 2 Gbit/s and operates over 4 types of legacy wires: telephone wiring, coaxial cables, power lines and plastic optical fiber. Some benefits of a multi-wire standard are lower equipment development costs and lower deployment costs for service providers (by allowing customer self-install).

**Time-division multiple access (TDMA)** is a channel access method for shared-medium networks. It allows several users to share the same frequency channel by dividing the signal into different time slots. The users transmit in rapid succession, one after the other, each using its own time slot. This allows multiple stations to share the same transmission medium (e.g. radio frequency channel) while using only a part of its channel capacity.

**Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)** in computer networking, is a network multiple access method in which carrier sensing is used, but nodes attempt to avoid collisions by beginning transmission only after the channel is sensed to be "idle". When they do transmit, nodes transmit their packet data in its entirety.

**Cable Internet access**, shortened to cable Internet, is a form of broadband internet access which uses the same infrastructure as cable television. Like digital subscriber line and fiber to the premises services, cable Internet access provides network edge connectivity (last mile access) from the Internet service provider to an end user.

**Dial-up Internet access** is a form of Internet access that uses the facilities of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) to establish a connection to an Internet service provider (ISP) by dialing a telephone number on a conventional telephone line which could be connected using an RJ-11 connector. Dial-up connections use modems to decode audio signals into data to send to a router or computer, and to encode signals from the latter two devices to send to another modem at the ISP.

**Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS)** is an international telecommunications standard that permits the addition of high-bandwidth data transfer to an existing cable television (CATV) system. It is used by many cable television operators to provide cable Internet access over their existing hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) infrastructure.

**Digital subscriber line (DSL)** is a family of technologies that are used to transmit digital data over telephone lines. In telecommunications marketing, the term DSL is widely understood to mean *asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL)*, the most commonly installed DSL technology, for Internet access.

**Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)** is a set of communication standards for simultaneous digital transmission of voice, video, data, and other network services *over the digitalised circuits of the public switched telephone network*. Work on the standard began in 1980 at Bell Labs and was formally standardized in 1988 in the CCITT "Red Book". By the time the standard was released, newer networking systems with much greater speeds were available, and ISDN saw relatively little uptake in the wider market.

**Multimedia over Coax Alliance (MoCA)** is an international standards consortium that publishes specifications for *networking over coaxial cable*. The technology was originally developed to distribute IP television in homes using existing cabling, but is now used as a general-purpose *Ethernet link* where it is inconvenient or undesirable to replace existing coaxial cable with *optical fiber* or *twisted pair cabling*.
