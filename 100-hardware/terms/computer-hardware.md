Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the CPU, RAM, motherboard, graphics card, storage, as well as peripheral devices ranging from various expansion cards, keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers, even the case.

In computing, an expansion card (also called an expansion board, adapter card, peripheral card or accessory card) is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an electrical connector, or expansion slot (also referred to as a bus slot) on a computer's motherboard (see also backplane) to add functionality to a computer system. Sometimes the design of the computer's case and motherboard involves placing most (or all) of these slots onto a separate, removable card.
