# Expansion card

In computing, an expansion card (aka expansion board, adapter card, peripheral card, accessory card) is a printed circuit board (PCB) that can be inserted into an electrical connector, or expansion slot (also referred to as a bus slot) on a computer's motherboard (see also backplane) to add functionality to a computer system. Sometimes the design of the computer's case and motherboard involves placing most (or all) of these slots onto a separate, removable card.
