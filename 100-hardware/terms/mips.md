https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture

Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages (MIPS) is a family of RISC instruction set architectures developed by MIPS Computer Systems (now MIPS Technologies, based in the US).

There are multiple versions of MIPS, including MIPS I, II, III, IV, V, and five releases of MIPS32/64. Current version of MIPS is MIPS32/64 Release 6 (2017).

MIPS32/64 primarily differs from MIPS I-V by defining the privileged kernel mode System Control Coprocessor, in addition to the user mode architecture.

The MIPS architecture has several optional extensions:
- MIPS-3D, a simple set of floating-point SIMD instructions for 3D graphics
- MDMX (MaDMaX), more extensive integer SIMD instruction set using 64-bit floating-point registers
- MIPS16e, adds compression to the instruction stream to reduce the memory programs require
- MIPS MT, adds multithreading capability

Computer architecture courses in universities and technical schools often study the MIPS architecture. The MIPS architecture has greatly influenced later RISC architectures such as Alpha. In March 2021, MIPS announced that the development of the MIPS architecture had ended as the company is making a transition to RISC-V.
