# RISC-V

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V

RISC-V (pronounced "risk-five" ) is an open standard ISA based on the RISC principles. The project began in 2010 at the University of California, Berkeley. It was transferred into the RISC-V Foundation in 2015, then to RISC-V International, a Swiss non-profit entity, in November 2019. Like several other RISC ISAs (e.g. Amber for ARMv2, or OpenRISC), RISC-V is offered under royalty-free open-source licenses.
