# Elements of computer architectures

Elements of computer architectures
1. Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
2. Microarchitecture/Computer organization
3. System Design/Implementation


**Instruction Set Architecture** (ISA) defines the instructions, in the form of machine code that a CPU can understand, machine's word size, memory address modes, processor registers and available data types.

**Microarchitecture**, or *computer organization*, defines a set of processor design techniques used in a particular processor to implement the instruction set.

**System Design** defines the remaining elements in a computer system: non-CPU data processing such as direct memory access (DMA), along with other concepts such as virtualization, multiprocessing, software features.
