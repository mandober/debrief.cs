# Microarchitecture

**Microarchitecture**, or *computer organization*, defines a set of processor design techniques used in a particular processor to implement the instruction set.

Processors with different microarchitectures can share a common instruction set. For example, Intel Pentium (IA64) and AMD Athlon (AMD64) implement nearly identical versions of the x86 instruction set, but have radically different internal designs.

Computer organization helps optimize performance-based products, it also helps plan the selection of a processor for a particular project.
