# Harvard architecture

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_architecture

The Harvard architecture is a computer architecture with separate storage and signal pathways for instructions and data. It contrasts with the von Neumann architecture, where program instructions and data share the same memory and pathways.




In early computer systems, machine instructions were stored on punch cards and data could be stored on another media such as magnetic tape. This kept the instructions and data entirely separate from one another, known as the Harvard architecture. In modern computer systems this can be achieved by using a central processing unit with two separate memory units, one to store machine instructions and another to store data, which are connected by different buses.
