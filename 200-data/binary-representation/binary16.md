Almost all modern uses follow the IEEE 754-2008 standard, where the 16-bit base-2 format is referred to as *binary16*, and the exponent uses 5 bits. This can express values in the range `± 65,504`, with the minimum value above 1 being `1 + 1/1024`.

Depending on the computer, half-precision can be over an order of magnitude faster than double precision, e.g. 550 PFLOPS for half-precision vs 37 PFLOPS for double precision on one cloud provider
