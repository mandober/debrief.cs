# ASCII arrangement of characters

ASCII uses just 7 bits of the standard byte; the unused bit is the leftmost bit, i.e. the most significant bit (msb).

0-based bit indexing:
```
b₇ b₆ b₅ b₄ b₃ b₂ b₁ b₀
7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
↑                    ↑
msb                lsb
```

Using the standard 0-based indexing, the 8 bits of a byte are labelled from 0 to 7. The two easily identifiable bits are the leftmost, also called the most significant bit (msb), and rightmost, called the least significant bit (lsb).





(LSB, rightmost) to 7 (MSB, leftmost).
