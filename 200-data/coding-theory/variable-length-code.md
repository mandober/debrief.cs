# Variable-length code

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_code

In coding theory, a **variable-length code** is a code which maps source symbols to a variable number of bits.

Variable-length codes can allow sources 
to be compressed and decompressed 
with zero error (lossless data compression) 
and still be read back symbol by symbol.

With the right coding strategy, 
an independent and identically-distributed source 
may be compressed almost arbitrarily close to its entropy.

This is in contrast to *fixed-length coding* methods, 
for which data compression is only possible 
for large blocks of data and any compression 
beyond the logarithm of the total number of possibilities 
comes with a finite probability of failure 
(though arbitrarily small probability).

Some variable-length coding strategies
- Huffman coding
- Lempel-Ziv coding
- arithmetic coding
- context-adaptive variable-length coding
