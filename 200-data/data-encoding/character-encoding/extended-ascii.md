# Extended ASCII

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_ASCII

Extended ASCII is a repertoire of character encodings that include (most of) the original 96 ASCII character set, plus up to 128 additional characters. The term "extended ASCII" has no formal definition and its use is often ambiguous.

The ISO standard *ISO 8859* was the first international standard to formalise a (limited) extension of the ASCII character set: of the many language variants it encoded, *ISO 8859-1*, aka *ISO Latin 1* (which supports most Western European languages) is best known in the West. Many more extended ASCII encodings sets exist - these are called **codepages** and there are more than 220 of them. Supporting multiple extended ASCII character sets via a bunch of different codepages was such a mess that prompted the invention of *Unicode*.
