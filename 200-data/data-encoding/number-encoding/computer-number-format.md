# Computer number format

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_number_format

A *computer number format* is the internal representation of numeric values in digital device hardware and software, such as in programmable calculators and computers.

Numerical values are stored as groupings of bits, such as bytes and words.

The encoding between numerical values and *bit patterns* is chosen for convenience of the operation of the computer; the encoding used by the computer's instruction set generally requires conversion for external use, such as for printing and display.

Different types of processors may have different internal representations of numerical values and different conventions are used for integer and real numbers.

Most calculations are carried out with number formats that fit into a processor *register*, but some software systems allow representation of arbitrarily large numbers using multiple words of memory.
