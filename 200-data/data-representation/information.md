# Information

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information

* **Information** may be thought of as the resolution of some uncertainty. Info answers the question of "what something is", defining its essential nature and characteristics.

* In communication, information is expressed as the *content of a message*. There are 6 components of *Shannon/Weaver model of communication*: sender (source), encoder, message, channel (medium), decoder, receiver (destination).

* **Uncertainty of an event** is measured by the probability of it occurring, to which it is inversely proportional; the more uncertain an event, the more information is required to resolve uncertainty of that event.

* **Unit of information** is the capacity of a data storage system or communication channel, used to measure the capacities of other systems. In information theory, units of information are used to measure the entropy of random variables and information contained in messages.

* **Bit** is the funamental unit of information and it is typically defined as the information entropy of a random binary variable that is 0 or 1 with equal probability, or the information that is gained when the value of such variable is consumed (when it becomes known). Bit is the capacity of a system that has only 2 states.

* **Binary digits** are concrete symbols (1 and 0) that can be placed in a bit. The name "bit" is portmanteau of "binary digit", but they are not the same: *a bit is the max amount of information that can be conveyed by a binary digit*.

> A bit is the max amount of information that can be conveyed by a binary digit.

* Information is also associated with *data* which represents values attributed to params. **Information is data within a context**, with some meaning attached. Information may be encoded and encrypted into various forms.

> Information is data within a context.


The information encoded in
- 1 coin flip : log₂(2¹) = log₂2  = 1 bit
- 2 coin flips: log₂(2²) = log₂4  = 2 bits
- 3 coin flips: log₂(2³) = log₂8  = 3 bits
- 4 coin flips: log₂(2⁴) = log₂16 = 4 bits
