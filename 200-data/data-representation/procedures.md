Procedure is a group of code that can be re-used multiple times.

Subroutine (sub) is a procedure that is only used for its side-effects, it does not return a value.

Strictly (as in mathematics), a function is a relation between sets, a mapping of elements from domain (range) to elements of co-domain (image).

Also, a function can be defined by its graph - as a set containing all the ordered pairs, made from elements taken from domain (and placed as the first element in the ordered pair) and the corresponding element of the co-domain (and placed as the second in the ordered pair).

A function is a mapping from set A to set B: 
$$f: A \to B$$

`f: A -> B`.

If both sets contain natural numbers: `A ⊆ ℕ, B ⊆ ℕ`, wecouldsay that the function maps $$f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$$

$$
A \xrightarrow{f} B \\
f: A \to B \\
\ \\
\forall{x}.x \in A. x \in \mathbb{N} \\
\forall{y}.y \in B. y \in \mathbb{N} \\
\ \\
R \subseteq A \times B \\
\forall{xy}.x \in A \land y \in B.(x,y) \in R \\
xRy
$$
