# Units of information

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_information

A **unit of information** is the capacity of some standard data storage system or communication channel, used to measure the capacities of other systems and channels.

The most commonly used units of data storage capacity are the bit, the capacity of a system that has only two states, and the byte (or octet), which is equivalent to eight bits. Multiples of these units can be formed from these with the SI prefixes (power-of-ten prefixes) or the newer IEC binary prefixes (power-of-two prefixes).
