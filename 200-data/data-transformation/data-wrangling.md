# Data wrangling

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling

**Data wrangling** (data munging, data massaging) is the process of transforming data from an upstream format (usualy a more "raw" format in which the data is stored) into one that is better suited for downstream purposes (analytics, extraction, summaries, etc.).

The goal of data wrangling is to assure quality and useful data. Data analysts typically spend the majority of their time in the process of data wrangling compared to the actual analysis of the data.

The process of data wrangling may include further munging, data visualization, data aggregation, training a statistical model, as well as many other potential uses. Data wrangling typically follows a set of general steps which begin with extracting the data in a raw form from the data source, "munging" the raw data (e.g. sorting) or parsing the data into predefined data structures, and finally depositing the resulting content into a data sink for storage and future use.
