## Data augmentation
Data augmentation in data analysis are techniques used to increase the amount of data by adding slightly modified copies of already existing data or newly created synthetic data from existing data. It acts as a regularizer and helps reduce overfitting when training a machine learning model. It is closely related to oversampling in data analysis.

## Data analysis

## Data modeling
Data modeling in software engineering is the process of creating a data model for an information system by applying certain formal techniques.

## Data visualization
Data visualization (data viz) is an interdisciplinary field that deals with the graphical representations of data. It is a particularly efficient way of visually presenting large amounts of data by showing a summary or overview.

A data set (or dataset) is a collection of data. In the case of tabular data, a data set corresponds to one or more database tables. Collection of documents or files may also construe a data set. In the open data discipline, data set is the unit to measure the information released in a public open data repository. The European data.europa.eu portal aggregates more than a million data sets.
