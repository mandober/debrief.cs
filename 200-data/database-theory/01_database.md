# Database Theory

**Database** (db) is an organized collection of data, commonly in a digital form, where the data are typically organized to model relevant aspects of reality, in a way that supports an easy retrieval of required information.

**Database system** includes:
* Database Engine (DBE)
* Database Management System (DBMS)
* Database Services
* Database Utilities


**Database Engine (DBE)** is the main component of database that directly manages the storage and manipulation of data. It often includes the database OS that is a layer between OS and the database engine.

**Database Management System** (DBMS) is the database interface that provides interaction and administration of the database.

**Database Services** are the software that provides a higher-order interaction with the database, such as Reporting Services.

**Database Utilities** provide non-essential supporting services, such as Database Migration, Database Monitoring, Import-Export Data Tools, Disaster Recovery, Failover Clustering, Database Mirroring, Database Backup, etc.


An **entity** is anything we store data about. Each **attribute** is a fact we store about the entity.


**Relational database** (RDB), dominant DB model since the 1980s, models data in rows and columns inside tables, using an SQL dialect for data management.

**Non-relational database** systems, emerging in 2000s, lack a data model, storing data in loosely structured documents and manipulating it without employing a strict query language like SQL, therefore earning the name **NoSQL**.



**Data Query Languages** (DQL) are used to make queries in databases and information systems (IS).


**Structured Query Language** (SQL) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).


**Information system** (IS) is a formal, sociotechnical, organizational systems designed to manage information. It has 4 components: technology, process, people and organizational structure. **Computer Information System** (CIS) is a software that runs a database (1); computer system supporting the db (2); system of people and computers that processes or interprets information (3).
