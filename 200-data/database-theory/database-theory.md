# Database Theory

Mathematically, database theory has sprung from the relational calculus. A db consists of tables, and each table is defined by a set of attributes (`n` columns), so a table row is an n-tuple.

tbl1
R1 = (id, name, debt)
     (0, "pete", 43)
     (1, "duke", -33)
     (2, "john", -15)

A × B × C
A = Nat
B = String
C = Int

R1 ⊆ Nat × String × Int
