# Types of databases


* [Active database][47] includes an event driven architecture that can respond to conditions both inside and outside the database.
* [Animation database][48] stores fragments of animations which can be accessed, analyzed and queried to develop and assemble new animations.
* [Back-end database][49] accessed by users indirectly through an external app rather than by application programming stored within the db itself or by low level manipulation of the data.
* [Bibliographic database][50], which stores bibliographic records, is an organized digital collection of references to published literature (journals, newspapers, conference proceedings, reports, government and legal publications, patents, books, etc.).
* [Centralized database][51] is a db located and maintained in one location, unlike a distributed database.
* [Cloud database][52] runs on a cloud computing platform.
* [Collection database][53] is a collection catalog of a museum or archive implemented using a computerized db, in which the institution's objects or material are catalogued.
* [Collective Optimization Database][54] is an open repository to enable sharing of benchmarks, data sets and optimization cases from the community, provide web services and plugins to analyze optimization data and predict program transformations or better hardware designs for multi-objective optimizations based on statistical and machine learning techniques provided there is enough information collected in the repository from multiple users.
* [Configuration management database][55]
* [Cooperative database][56] holds info on customers and their transactions.
* [Correlation database][57] is a DBMS that is data-model-independent and designed to efficiently handle unplanned, ad hoc queries in an analytical system environment.
* [Current database][58] is a db that stores data that is valid now.
* [Directory][59] is a repository or db of info which is optimized for reading, under the assumption that data updates are rare compared to data reads. It supports search and browsing in addition to lookups.
* [Distributed database][60] is a db in which storage devices are not all attached to a common CPU.
* [Document-oriented database][61] is a computer program designed for storing, retrieving, and managing document-oriented, or semi-structured data.
* [EDA database][62] is a db specialized in electronic design automation.
* [Endgame tablebase][63] is a digital db that contains pre-calculated exhaustive analysis of a chess endgame position.
* [Food composition database][64] (FCDB) provides detailed information on the nutritional composition of foods.
* [Full-text database][65] is a db that contains the complete text of books, dissertations, journals, magazines, newspapers or other kinds of textual documents. Also called *complete-text database*.
* [Government database][66] collects personal info for various reasons (mass surveillance, social security, statistics, etc.).
* [Graph database][67] uses graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data.
* [Knowledge base][68] is a special kind of db for knowledge management. A knowledge base provides a means for information to be collected, organised, shared, searched and utilised.
* [Mobile database][69] can be connected to by a mobile computing device over a mobile network.
* [Navigational database][70] is a db in which objects (or records) in it are found primarily by following references from other objects.
* [Non-native speech database][71] is a speech db of non-native pronunciations of English.
* [Online database][72] is a db accessible from a network, the Internet.
* [Operational database][73] is a db accessed by an Operational System to carry out regular operations of an organization.
* [Parallel database][74] improves performance through parallelization of various operations, such as loading data, building indexes and evaluating queries.
* [Probabilistic database][75] is an uncertain db in which the possible worlds have associated probabilities.
* [Real-time database][76] is a processing system designed to handle workloads whose state is constantly changing.
* [Relational database][77] is a collection of data items organized as a set of formally described tables from which data can be accessed easily.
* [Spatial database][78] is a db that is optimized to store and query data that is related to objects in space, including points, lines and polygons.
* [Temporal database][79] is a db with built-in time aspects, e.g. a temporal data model and a temporal version of SQL.
* [Time series database][80] is an associative array of numbers indexed by a datetime or a datetime range. These time series are often called profiles or curves. A time series of stock prices might be called a price curve, or a time series of energy consumption might be called a load profile. Despite the disparate naming, the operations performed on them are sufficiently common as to demand special database treatment.
* [Triplestore][81] is a purpose-built db for the storage and retrieval of triples; a triple is a data entity composed of subject-predicate-object.
* [Very large database][82] (VLDB) contains an extremely high number of tuples (rows) or occupies an extremely large physical filesystem storage space.
* [Virtual private database][83] (VPD) masks data in a larger db so that security allows only the use of apparently private data.
* [Vulnerability database][84] collects, maintains and disseminates info about discovered vulnerabilities targeting real computer systems.
* [XLDB][85] stands for *eXtremely Large Data Base*.
* [XML database][86] is a data stored in XML format, where it can be queried, exported and serialized into the desired format.
