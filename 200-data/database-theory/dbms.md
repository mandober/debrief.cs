# Database management system

Formally, a "database" refers to a set of related data and the way it is organized. Access to this data is usually provided by a *Database Management System* (DBMS), which is a piece of software that allows users to interact with one or more databases. DBMS provides functions for data entry, storage and retrieval of data and ways to manage organization of data.

Because of the close relationship between a database and a DBMS, the term "database" often refers to both a database and the DBMS.

DBMS functions:
1. Data definition: creation and modification of definitions that define the organization of the data.
2. Update: insert, update, delete of the data.
3. Retrieval: providing information in a form directly usable or for further processing by other apps. The retrieved data may be made available in a form basically the same as it is stored in the db or in a new form obtained by altering or combining existing data from the db.
4. Administration: register and monitor users, enforce data security, monitor performance, maintain data integrity, deal with concurrency control, recover data that has been corrupted by some event (e.g. unexpected system failure).
