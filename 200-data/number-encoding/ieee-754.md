- 1985 IEEE 754-1985 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic
- 2008 IEEE 754-2008 revision of and replaces IEEE 754-1985
- 2019 IEEE 754-2019 minor revision of IEEE 754-1985

The 2008 revision extended the previous standard where it was necessary, added decimal arithmetic and formats, tightened up certain areas of the original standard which were left undefined, and merged in 

- 1987 IEEE 854-1987 Standard for Radix-Independent Floating-Point Arithmetic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_854-1987 Radices other than 2


IEEE Standard for Radix-Independent Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 854), was the first Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) international standard for floating-point arithmetic with radices other than 2, including radix 10.

IEEE 854 did not specify any data formats, whereas IEEE 754-1985 did specify formats for binary (radix 2) floating point. IEEE 754-1985 and IEEE 854-1987 were both superseded in 2008 by IEEE 754-2008, which specifies floating-point arithmetic for both radix 2 (binary) and radix 10 (decimal), and specifies two alternative formats for radix 10 floating-point values, and even more so with IEEE 754-2019.

IEEE 754-2008 also had many other updates to the IEEE floating-point standardisation.

IEEE 854 arithmetic was first commercially implemented in the HP-71B handheld computer, which used decimal floating point with 12 digits of significand, and an exponent range of Â±499, with a 15 digit significand used for intermediate results.
