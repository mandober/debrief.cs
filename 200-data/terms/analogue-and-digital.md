# Analogue and digital data

- Analogue data has a continuous range of values.
- Digital data has a discrete range of values.
- Digital circuits are based on two sufficiently distinguishable states, usually called logical high and logical low.
- Digital data is composed of sequences of binary values.
- analogue data is usually represented in a wave form.



## Analogue-digital conversion
Analogue to digital converter (ADC) samples (measures) an analogue signal (e.g. sound wave) repeatedly for some unit of time. This sampling rate must happen sufficiently often in order to "capture" every change in the analog signal. For example, thesamplingrate of a vibrant musical piece with sudden and frequent changes needs to very high.

16/24 bit:
- 44,100 Hz (CD quality)
- 44,800 Hz (DVD quality)
- 96,000 Hz (studio quality)
- 192,000 Hz (pro studio quality)

Digital to analogue converters often use *Pulse Width Modulation* (PWM) to approximate the shape of analogue waves.

The common usage of digital to analogue converters (DAC) is in a sound card. The digitally stored audio is converted to analogue voltages, which are then passed to speakers which convert them into sound.

## data signaling rate
In telecommunication, data signaling rate (DSR), also known as gross bit rate, is the aggregate rate at which data pass a point in the transmission path of a data transmission system.
