# Data

Data
* Qualitative data
* Quantitative data
  - discrete data, digital data
  - continuous data, analog data


Generally, data (singular: datum) is a set of values i.e. collection of facts (such as numbers used in measurements, words used in observations or descriptions, etc.) about an entity.

## Qualitative and quantitative
The basic classification of data could be made by the quality vs quantity approach (words vs numbers): *qualitative data* pertains to descriptive information, while *quantitative data* pertains to numeric information obtained from measurement.

## Discrete and continuous
Quantitative data can be further identified as *discrete data* if it consists of concrete, distinct, values (e.g. like integers that have discrete points in the continuum), and *continuous data*, which would take the form of intervals (e.g. like real numbers that lack discrete stops but appear continuously throughout the number's line).

Discrete data only takes on certain values (discrete stops along the continuum), disregarding the infinities between any two successive points. For example, division of integers has to employ a particular resolution (rounding) strategy in order to obtain a valid (but possibly unprecise) discrete value. On the other hand, continuous data can take on any value within a range.

Discrete data can be counted. Continuous data is measured.


## Collecting data
Collecting the data about each and every member of a set (domain, population) is called *census* and it usually presents a difficult or impossible challenge. Therefore, a *sample* i.e. collecting the data only from a certain subset of the whole set, is an acceptable compromise.



## Data collecting
Data and information are often used interchangeably, however, data only becomes information when it is interpreted (viewed in context or in post-analysis).

Data is measured, collected and reported, and analyzed, whereupon it can be visualized using graphs, images or other analysis tools.

Data, as a general concept, refers to the fact that some existing information is represented or coded in some form suitable for better usage or processing.


## Raw data
Raw data, also known as primary data, is data (e.g., numbers, instrument readings, figures, etc.) collected from a source,

Raw, unprocessed data (also called primary data) is an aggregation of data before it undergoes through the necessary recalibration process (e.g. removing *outliers*, obvious instrument reading errors, data-entry errors, etc.)

Data processing commonly occurs by stages, and the "processed data" from one stage may be considered the "raw data" of the next stage. Field data is raw data that is collected in an uncontrolled, "in situ", environment. Experimental data is data that is generated within the context of a scientific investigation by observation and recording.


## Data set
A *data set* is a collection of data.

Most commonly a data set corresponds to the contents of a single database table, or a single statistical *data matrix*, where every column of the table represents a particular variable, and each row corresponds to a given member of the data set in question. The data set lists values for each of the variables, such as height and weight of an object, for each member of the data set. Each value is known as a *datum*. The data set may comprise data for one or more members, corresponding to the number of rows.

The term data set may also be used more loosely, to refer to the data in a collection of closely related tables, corresponding to a particular experiment or event. Less used names for this kind of data sets are *data corpus* and *data stock*. An example of this type is the data sets collected by space agencies performing experiments with instruments aboard space probes.

Data sets that are so large that traditional data processing applications are inadequate to deal with them are known as *big data*.

## Median value
The median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample (a population or a probability distribution). For a data set, it may be thought of as the "middle" value. For example, in the data set {1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}, the median is 6, the fourth largest, and also the fourth smallest, number in the sample. For a continuous probability distribution, the median is the value such that a number is equally likely to fall above or below it.

## Mean value
The median value is the quotient of the sum of all member values in dataset, divided by the number of members in that set. For example, in the data set {1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}, the mean is (1+3+3+6+7+8+9)/7 = 37/7 =~ 5.25714



## Data in CS
In computing, data is any sequence of symbols whose meaning follows from the interpretation.
