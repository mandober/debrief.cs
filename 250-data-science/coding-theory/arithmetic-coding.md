# Arithmetic coding

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_coding

**Arithmetic coding (AC)** is a form of *entropy encoding* used in lossless data compression.

Normally, a string of characters is represented using a fixed number of bits per character, as in the ASCII code. When a string is converted to arithmetic encoding, frequently used characters will be stored with fewer bits and not-so-frequently occurring characters will be stored with more bits, resulting in fewer bits used in total.

Arithmetic coding differs from other forms of entropy encoding, 
such as Huffman coding, in that 
rather than separating the input into component symbols 
and replacing each with a code, 
arithmetic coding encodes the entire message 
into a single number, 
an arbitrary-precision fraction `q`, 
where `0.0 ⩽ q ⩽ 1.0`. 
It represents the current information 
as a range, defined by two numbers.

A recent family of entropy coders called *asymmetric numeral systems* 
allows for faster implementations 
thanks to directly operating 
on a single natural number 
representing the current information.
