# Data compression

In information theory, **data compression** (source coding, bit-rate reduction) is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation.

Any particular compression is either lossy or lossless.

*Lossless compression* reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression.

*Lossy compression* reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information.

Typically, a device that performs data compression is referred to as an *encoder*, and one that performs the reversal of the process (decompression) as a *decoder*.
