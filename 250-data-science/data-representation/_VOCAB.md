# Information Theory: Glossary

## Information
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information
Information is associated with data, as data represents values attributed to parameters. Information is data within a context, with some meaning attached. Information may be encoded for consumption, transmition and storage.

## Entropy
Entropy is the opposite of information; entropy of a system decreases as one obtains more information it. In information theory, the entropy of a random variable is the average level of information ("surprise" or "uncertainty") inherent in the variable's possible outcomes. There is no uncertainty about an outcome if one has all the information about it. For example, the probability of tails or heads, i.e. maximum uncertainty of a coin flip is p = 1/2, so a coin flip has an entropy of 1 bit. The minimum surprise is when p = 0 or p = 1, which is when the probability of an event occuring is known (does not occur is 0, occurs is 1); then the entropy is 0 bits. Other values of p give different entropies between 0 and 1 bit.

The concept of information entropy was introduced by Claude Shannon in his 1948 paper "A Mathematical Theory of Communication"

## Data

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data

Values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items. Data in computing (or data processing) are often represented by a combination of items organized in rows and multiple variables organized in columns. Data are typically the results of measurements and can be visualised using graphs or images.

## Computer data

Information in a form suitable for use with a computer. Data is often distinguished from programs. A program is a sequence of instructions that detail a task for the computer to perform. In this sense, data is everything in software that is not program code.



## Information technology

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology

Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate information (data). IT is considered to be a subset of *information and communications technology* (ICT). An *information technology system* (ITS) is generally an information system, a communications system or, more specifically, a computer system, including all hardware, software and peripheral equipment, operated by a limited group of users.

## Information and communications technology

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology

Information and communications technology (ICT) is an extensional term for *information technology* (IT) that stresses the role of unified communications and the integration of telecommunications and computers, as well as necessary enterprise software, middleware, storage and audiovisual systems, that enable users to access, store, transmit, and manipulate information. The term ICT is also used to refer to the convergence of audiovisual and telephone networks with computer networks through a single cabling or link system. ICT is an umbrella term that includes any communication device, encompassing radio, television, cell phones, computer and network hardware, satellite systems and so on, as well as the various services and appliances with them such as video conferencing and distance learning.

## Informatics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics

Informatics is the study of natural and engineered computational systems. The central notion is the transformation of information. Informatics is European equivalent for both computer science and computing as a discipline, sometimes synonymous with computer science and engineering. In US, however, informatics is linked with computing in context of another domain, most often associated with applications computer technology in healthcare. On the other hand, in UK and Japan the term informatics is associated with the study of natural and neural computation.
