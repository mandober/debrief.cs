## Nibble

A **nibble** (occasionally *nybble*, *nyble*, or *nybl* to match the spelling of "byte") is a 4-bit aggregation, or half an octet. It is also called as *half-byte* or *tetrade*.

In networking, the nibble is often called *semi-octet*, *quadbit* or *quartet*.

A nibble has 16 (2⁴) possible values.

A nibble can be represented by a single *hex digit*.

A full byte (octet) is represented by 2 hexadecimal digits (00-FF); therefore, it is common to display a byte of information as two nibbles. Sometimes the set of all 256-byte values is represented as a 16×16 table, which gives easily readable hexadecimal codes for each value (usually with rows as the first hex digit, and columnd as the second).
