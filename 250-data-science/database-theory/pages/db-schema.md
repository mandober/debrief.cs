# Database schema

The database schema is the structure of a database system described in a formal language supported by the DBMS. The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the db is constructed (e.g. divided into tables in the case of relational databases).

The formal definition of a database schema is a set of formulas (sentences) called *integrity constraints* imposed on a database. These integrity constraints ensure compatibility between parts of the schema. All constraints are expressible in the same language. A db can be considered a structure in realization of the database language. The states of a created conceptual schema are transformed into an explicit mapping, the database schema. This describes how real-world entities are modeled in the database.

A db schema specifies, based on the DBA's knowledge of possible applications, the facts that can enter the db (or those of interest to the end-users).

In a *relational database*, the schema defines:
- tables
- fields
- relationships
- views
- indexes
- packages
- procedures
- functions
- queues
- triggers
- types
- sequences
- materialized views
- synonyms
- database links
- directories
- XML schemas
