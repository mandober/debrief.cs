# Relational database theory

**Relational model** (RM), as described by Edgar Frank Codd in 1969, is an approach to data management using the structure and language that rely on first-order predicate logic. Data is represented in terms of tuples and grouped into relations.

**Relational database** (RDB), or *relational database system* (RDBS), is a database design based on the *relational data model*, as described by Edgar Codd in 1970 and later popularized by Christopher J. Date and Hugh Darwen.

**Relational database management system** (RDBMS) is a software utility used to design, administer, query, and otherwise manipulate, a relational database.

**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is the most prevalent DDL/DML used with relational db systems.
