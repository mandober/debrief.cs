- IT is a subset of `Information and Communications Technology` (ICT)
- `Information Technology` is the use of computers for data management

IT subfields
- source coding
- channel coding
- algorithmic complexity theory
- algorithmic information theory
- information-theoretic security
- measurement of information

IT applications
- data compression
- channel coding
- information retrieval
- intelligence gathering
- statistics

In information theory, units of information are used to measure the entropy of random variables and information contained in messages.
