# Types of data structure

**Kinetic data structure**
A kinetic data structure is a data structure used to track an attribute of a geometric system that is moving continuously. For example, a kinetic convex hull data structure maintains the convex hull of a group of m moving points. The development of kinetic data structures was motivated by computational geometry problems involving physical objects in continuous motion, such as collision or visibility detection in robotics, animation or computer graphics.
