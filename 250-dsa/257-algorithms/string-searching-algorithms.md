# String-searching algorithms

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String-searching_algorithm

**String-searching (-matching) algorithms** try to find the position, where a pattern string (needle) is found (starts from), in a larger string (heystack). String-searching is commonly constrained by various conditions, such as space delimited match, match must occur at the beginning, normalization, character equivalence classes, character collation,

Search algorithms
- na√Øve string search
- finite-state-automaton-based search
- stubs
- index methods

Classification of search algorithms
- by the number of patterns
  - single-pattern algorithms
  - finite set of patterns
  - infinite number of patterns
- by the use of preprocessing
- by matching strategies
