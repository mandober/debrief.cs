# DSA common

The topics on the intersection of data structures and algorithms.

DSA - Data Structures and Algorithms
1. DSA general (shared subjects)
2. Algorithms
3. Data Structures

1. DSA genral              dsaGen    dsa-gen
2. Algorithms      (Alg)   dsaAlg    dsa-alg
3. Data Structures (DS)    dsaTypes  dsa-dt


1. DSA (shared subjects and meta topics)
  - collections
  - Boom hierarchy

2. Algorithms
  - space and time complexity (see Theory of Computation)
    - space complexity
    - time complexity
    - big o notation (O, Θ, Ω)
    - asymptotic analysis 
    - amortization
  - types of algorithms
    - by the way they get data
      - online
      - offline
    - by the strategy
      - recursive
      - divide and conquer
      - dynamic planning (dynamic programming)
      - seek and destroy
      - use heuristics
    - by conrete use and purpose
      - for sorting
      - for searching

3. Data Structures
  - DS in general
    - data structure
    - data type
    - data structure elements
      - data
        - payload, user-data, "useful" data, `raison d'être` pur cete DS
        - attached information
        - administrative, bureaucratic data (the overhead)
        - metadata (label)
      - structure
        - cells, nodes
        - node labeling
  - DS classification
    - by the amount of storage/administration required
      - succint
      - overhead
      - 
    - by concrete type
      - trees
    - by concrete use
      - Bloom filter
