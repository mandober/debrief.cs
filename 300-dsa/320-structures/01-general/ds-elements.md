# Elements of data structures



The **overhead** is the cost of the structural and administrative data; it is the size of data used to construct the structure itself and to provide desired functionality and maintainance.

The overhead data is distinct from the **payload** data, which is the data being stored, i.e. the data that uses a data structure's storage facilities.

Every data structure has to make a tradeoff between the overhead, available storage capacity and the cost of computational complexity.
