# Hash function

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function

A **hash function** is any function that can be used 
to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values.

The values returned by a hash function are called **hashes** 
(hash values, hash codes, digests).

Hashes are used to index into a fixed-size table called a **hash table**.

The use of a hash function to index a hash table is called **hashing** (or scatter storage addressing).
