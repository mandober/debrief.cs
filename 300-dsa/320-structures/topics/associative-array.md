# Associative Array

https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Associative_array

An associative array (map, symbol table, dictionary) is an abstract data type composed of a collection of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection.

Operations:
- `insert`: addition of a pair to the collection
- `delete`: removal of a pair from the collection
- `search`: the lookup of a value associated with a particular key
- `edit`: modification of an existing pair

The __dictionary problem__ is a classic computer science problem: the task of designing a data structure that maintains a set of data during _search_, _delete_, and _insert_ operations. The two major solutions to the dictionary problem are a _hash table_ or a _search tree_. In some cases it is also possible to solve the problem using directly addressed arrays (when the keys are restricted to a narrow range of integers), binary search trees or other more specialized structures.

Associative arrays have many applications including such fundamental programming patterns as memoization and the decorator pattern.
