# Data structure

Data structure vs Data type: A data structure is a compound data type, so all data structures are data types, but not all data types are data structures. At least, it is rare that one would call, e.g. integers a data structure, but on the other hand, a more complex implementation of some number type can be - although even if a number is implemented as a tree, we'd rather call the tree a data structure that it being used to represent a number.
