# Tree

Any recursive data type that exhibits a nonlinear structure is generically called a tree. Trees serve as natural representations for any form of hierarchically organised data. The syntactic structure of arithmetic or functional expressions can also be modelled by a tree. Perhaps most useful of all, trees provide a generalisation of lists as a means for organising information and retrieving it efficiently.

There are numerous species and subspecies of tree. Trees can be classified according to the precise form of the branching structure, the location of information within the tree, and the relationship between the information stored in different parts of the tree.
