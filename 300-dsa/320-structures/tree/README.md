* Mathematics:
  - Tree in graph theory: a connected acyclic graph
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)

  - Tree in set theory: like a graph-theory tree, but with a distinguished
    root, and possibly having chains of transfinite length
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(set_theory)

  - Tree in descriptive set theory: a set of finite sequences of elements of X
    that is closed under subsequences, on a set X
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(descriptive_set_theory)

  - Tree diagram in probability theory:
    a tree-like representation of a probability space
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_diagram_(probability_theory)

  - `TREE`: an extremely fast-growing function (see Kruskal's tree theorem)
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_tree_theorem
    *Kruskal's tree theorem* states that the set of finite trees over a well-quasi-ordered set of labels is itself well-quasi-ordered under homeomorphic embedding.

* Computing
  - Tree data structure: a widely used CS data structure that emulates a tree structure with a set of linked nodes
  - Tree in automata theory
  - Tree network: a type of computer and communication network topology

  - Digital tree (prefix tree, trie): a CS ordered tree data structure
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_tree

  - `tree` unix command: a recursive dir listing that produces a list of FS
    items indented by their depth
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(command)
  - Parse tree is used to represent a program or expressions of a PL
  - AST represents expressions augmented with more info
  - Tree structure (tree diagram): representing a hierarchical nature of structure graphically


* Information representation
  - Tree structure (tree diagram) represents hierarchical nature of structure
  - Decision tree is a tree model of decisions and their consequences
  - Parse tree in linguistics represents the syntax of sentences
  - Dialogue tree is used to generate conversations
  - Family tree is used in genealogy to show familial relationships
