# Sorting algorithm

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm

A **sorting algorithm** is an algorithm that arranges the elements of a sequence in a certain order (e.g. increasing order for numeric data, lexicographical order for strings).

Being sorted may be desired or a required property of a sequence, in order to make sure algorithms, such as searching, are as efficient, or even possible; or just to improve digestion of data in case of human consumption.

Semi-formally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:
- The output is monotonic (ASC or DESC)
- The output is a permutation of the input

A metaphor for comparison sorts is a set of objects and a scale with the goal of sorting the objects according to their weights, by relying only on the information obtained from weighting a pair of objects at the time; the subgoal is to optimize (minimize) the number of comparisons.

* Sorting small arrays optimally (the smallest number of comparisons and swaps) or fast (accounting for machine specific details) is still an open research problem, with solutions known only for arrays with ~ 20 elements. Optimal sorting (by various definition) in parallel is an open research topic.


Some commom comparison sorts algorithms include:
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Bubble sort
- Quicksort
- Heapsort
- Shellsort
- Introsort
- Odd-even sort
- Cocktail shaker sort
- Cycle sort
- Merge-insertion sort
- Smoothsort
- Timsort
- Block sort
- Library sort

* *Comparison sorting algorithms* have a fundamental requirement of `Ω(n log n)` comparisons - a comparison sort must have an average-case lower bound of Ω(n log n) comparison operations (called *linearithmic time*). This is a consequence of the limited information available through comparisons alone; or, put differently, of the vague algebraic structure of totally ordered sets. Non-comparison sorts can achieve O(n) performance by using operations other than comparisons, allowing them to sidestep this lower bound.
