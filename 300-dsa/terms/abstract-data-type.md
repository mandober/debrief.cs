# Abstract data type

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type

An abstract data type (ADT) is a mathematical model (template) for data types.

An **abstract data type** is defined by its behavior (semantics), from the aspect of the data consumer; specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type and the behavior of these operations. That is, of all the things that may be cosidered a data type's *interface* or an *API*.

This mathematical model contrasts with *data structures* that are concrete representations of data, which are considered from the aspect of the implementer (not from the user's aspect like ADT).

implementer's side   | user's side
↓        ↓       ↓   | ↓    ↓    ↓
data structures (DS) | abstract data type (ADT)
concrete data repr   | interface, API

> An ADT describes WHAT a data structure does, i.e. its behavior, while its implementation describes HOW the data structure does it.
