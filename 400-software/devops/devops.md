## IaC
Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. The IT infrastructure managed by this comprises both physical equipment such as bare-metal servers as well as virtual machines and associated configuration resources. The definitions may be in a version control system.

## Data center
specialized space (building, floor, room) dedicated to housing computer systems. Large cloud computing providers have data centers in geographical locations of interest.

## Bare-metal server
computer server that is a single-tenant physical server. The term is used nowadays to distinguish it from modern forms of virtualization and cloud hosting.

## Virtual machine
VM is an emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.

## Configuration management
CM is a systems engineering process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a product's performance, functional, and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and operational information throughout its life. The CM process is widely used by military engineering organizations to manage changes throughout the system lifecycle of complex systems, such as weapon systems, military vehicles, and information systems.

## Server provisioning
Server provisioning is a set of actions to prepare a server with appropriate systems, data and software, and make it ready for network operation.

## Service choreography
a form of service composition in which the interaction protocol between several partner services is defined from a global perspective. The idea underlying the notion of service choreography can be summarised as follows: "Dancers dance following a global scenario without a single point of control"

## Service-oriented architecture
SOA is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. The basic principles of service-oriented architecture are independent of vendors, products and technologies. A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as retrieving a credit card statement online.

## Orchestration
Orchestration is the automated configuration, coordination, and management of computer systems and software. A number of tools exist for automation of server configuration and management, including Ansible, Puppet, Salt, Terraform, and AWS CloudFormation. For *Container Orchestration* there are different solutions such as *Kubernetes* software or managed services such as AWS EKS, AWS ECS or Amazon Fargate.

## Kubernetes
*k8s* is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management. It was originally designed by Google, and is now maintained by the *Cloud Native Computing Foundation*. It aims to provide a "platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts".

## Hardware virtualization
is the virtualization of computers as complete hardware platforms, certain logical abstractions of their componentry, or only the functionality required to run various operating systems. Virtualization hides the physical characteristics of a computing platform from the users, presenting instead an abstract computing platform. At its origins, the software that controlled virtualization was called a "control program", but the terms "hypervisor" or "virtual machine monitor" became preferred over time.

## Converged infrastructure
is a way of structuring an information technology (IT) system which groups multiple components into a single optimized computing package. Components of a converged infrastructure may include servers, data storage devices, networking equipment and software for IT infrastructure management, automation and orchestration.
