# OS :: Abbreviations

## ACPI
Advanced Configuration and Power Interface combines the earlier APM and PnP BIOS into an enhanced power management system.

## APM
Advanced Power Management

## BIOS
Basic I/O System is a firmware flashed onto a ROM chip on the motherboard, and hardwired to provide the initial instructions to the CPU when a computer is turned on. These initial instructions check and test the available hardware, after which the boot device is selected and its boot sector loaded (thereby loading the OS).

## CIM
Common Information Model

## DRAM
Dynamic random-access memory is the type of volitile, cheapest, crammed, but sufficiently efficient memory that makes up the primary memory storage. DRAM memory needs to be constantly refreshed lest it looses the stored value (it leeks charge, leeks electrons).

## DMI
Desktop Management Interface

## EFI
Extensible Firmware Interface

## OEM
Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) is generally perceived as a company that produces non-aftermarket parts and equipment that may be marketed by another manufacturer. It is a common industry term recognized and used by many professional organizations.

## POST
Power-on Self Test is the testing and initialization of the hardware performed by BIOS on boot.

## PnP
Plug and Play is the term used for hardware or software products that just workâ„¢, simply by being plugged in, without the need to configure them first.

## RAM
Random-Access Memory is the type of, usually volitile, memory that supports reading and writting (and overwritting it many times).

## ROM
Read-Only Memory is the non-volitile type of memory that only supports reading; the data it contains is burned in (flashed) and cannot change. However, despite the name, the term is used to refer to reprogrammable memory as well, when it means that the data can be changed, although it infrequently is. For example, the BIOS is often said to be on a ROM chip, although the BIOS is expected to be updated when the motherboard manufacturer releases an update (e.g. to fix bugs, to support newer CPUs, etc.).

## SMBIOS
System Management BIOS is a specification that defines data structures and access methods to get the information about the hardware produced by the BIOS, thereby eliminating the need for the OS to probe hardware directly in order to discover available devices.

## SRAM
Static random-access memory is a type of volitile, very expensive but very efficient memory, primarily used as CPU registers. A SRAM cell is usually made of 4 transistors and, unlike DRAM, it doesn't need refreshing.

## UEFI
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface

## WBEM
Web-Based Enterprise Management
