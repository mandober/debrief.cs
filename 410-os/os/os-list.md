CP/M, originally standing for Control Program/Monitor, later for Control Program for Microcomputers, is an 8-bit OS developed by Gary Kildall from Digital Research. It resembles DOS that was forked in 1980. CP/M has 3 main versions: 1.4, 2.2 and 3.1. The version 2.2 was the basis of MSDOS, while v3.1 evolved into DRDOS and OpenDOS. There were also 8086 and 68000 versions of CP/M. CP/M-86 evolved into DOS Plus, Concurrent DOS and REAL/32. CP/M was the first system to use the "8.3" notation for filenames (8 characters for the stem, 3 characters for the suffix); the suffix was used to identify the type of a file.
