An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

Common OS features
- Scheduler
- Process management
- Interrupts
- Memory management
- File system
- Device drivers
- Networking
- Security
- Input/output

Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.

For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware, although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes *system calls* to an OS function or is interrupted by it.

Common general-purpose personal computer operating systems are Windows, macOS and Linux. Linux and macOS are more closely related - macOS has originated as a BSD fork (Darwin), while Linux inherited many aspects of UNIX. Windows and macOS are proprietary products, while Linux is open source. Linux distributions are dominant as servers, in the supercomputing sector, embedded devices, real-time systems, and generally any other specialized use and aspect including scenarios that demand higher security, reliability, availability, low hardware requirements. Linux distros also support being run entirely from removable media such as flash drives and memory cards, even (live) CDs.
