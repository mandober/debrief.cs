# System call

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call

A **system call** (syscall) is a programmatic way for programs to request services from the kernel. System calls provide an essential interface between a process and the OS.

The services include hardware-related services (e.g. access to disk, camera, scanner, etc.), creation and execution of processes, communication with the integral kernel services (e.g. paging, process scheduling).

In most systems, system calls can only be made from userspace processes, while in some systems (OS/360 and successors) privileged system code also issues system calls.
