# Unreal mode

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_mode

In x86 computing, unreal mode (aka big real mode, flat real mode, voodoo mode) is a variant of real mode, in which one or more *segment descriptors* has been loaded with non-standard values, like 32-bit limits allowing access to the entire memory.

Contrary to its name, it is not a separate addressing mode that the x86 processors can operate in. It is used in the 80286 and later x86 processors.
