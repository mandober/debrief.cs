A **Win32 console** has an input buffer and screen buffers. The **input buffer** contains a queue of input records, each of which contains information about an *input event*. The *input queue* includes *key-press and key-release events*. It may also include *mouse events* (pointer movements and button presses and releases), as well as *window-resizing events* that affect the size of the active screen buffer. A **screen buffer** is a two-dimensional array of character and attribute data intended for output (stdout, stderr) in a console window. A number of processes can share a single console.
