# Anonymous function

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function

An *anonymous function* (more rarely, a *function literal*, *function expression* or *function block*) is a function definition that is not bound to an identifier.

Anonymous functions are often used as arguments, being passed to higher-order functions or used for constructing the result of a higher-order function that needs to return a function.

If the function is intended to only be used once, an anonymous function may be syntactically lighter than using a separately defined *named function*.
