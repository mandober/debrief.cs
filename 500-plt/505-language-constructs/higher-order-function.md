# Higher-order function

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function

*Higher-order functions* are functions that take functions as arguments.

An example of a higher-ordered function is the `map` function, which takes, as its arguments, a function and a list, and returns a new list by applying the function to each element. For a language to support map, it must support passing a function as an argument.
