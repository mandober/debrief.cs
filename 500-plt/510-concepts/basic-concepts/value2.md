# Value

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(computer_science)

* A set is to its elements what type is to its terms, which are values. The members of some particular type are the values of that type.; Boolean type traditionally has two values.

* A value is a representation of some entity that can be managed by a program. The notion of value ranges heavily across the entitirs of a PL; a value may be very concrete, e.g. the integer 5 is a value and as a value it is a concrete value, a primitive value, a literal value; it is immediate, scalar, numeric, integral, static, stack-based, atomic value. However, a value may also be a very abstract thing, such as file handle, a list, tree, array, reference, pointer, and many other things from many different language categories.

* A value is most often associated with a variable. The value of a variable is given by the corresponding mapping in the environment. (Imperative) languages with *assignable variables* may distinguish between the r-value (contents) and the l-value (location: memory address or a reference) of a variable. In declarative PLs, values are *referentially transparent*, which means the resulting value of an expression is independent of the location in which a subexpression needed to compute the value is stored - only the content of the location (the bits, the 1's and 0's) and their interpretation is significant.
