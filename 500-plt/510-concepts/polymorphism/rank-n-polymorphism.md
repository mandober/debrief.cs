# Rank-N Polymorphism

__NOTE__: Rank-N polymorphism is not to be confused with *rank polymorphism*, which is a type of polymorphism where an operation over the values of a lower "rank" (such as a function over scalar values) is automatically lifted to work (element- wise) over the values of a higher "rank" (such as arrays).
