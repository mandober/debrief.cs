# Regular expression

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression

A *regular expression* (sometimes rational expression) is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern for string-searching algorithms.

The concept of regular expressions comes from theoretical computer science and formal language theory. The study was initiated in 1950s with Kleene's formalization of a *regular language*.

Different syntaxes for writing regular expressions have existed since the 1980s; more prominent are the POSIX standard and the Perl standard which is the most popular. `PCRE` are Perl-compatible regular expressions.

Regular expressions came into common use with Unix text-processing utilities. They are used mainly related to text searching, in search engines, "find and replace" dialogs of text editors, in utilities such as `sed` and `awk`, in lexical analysis. The last point is discouraged because although regexp are ubiquitous, readily available and fairly easy to use, they have a strictly defined set of languages on which they can be used, namely, regular languages; beware of zalgo: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/#1732454
