# Dataflow programming

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming

In computer programming, dataflow programming is a programming paradigm that models a program as a directed graph of the data flowing between operations, thus implementing dataflow principles and architecture.

Dataflow PLs share some features of FPL, and were generally developed in order to bring some functional concepts to a language more suitable for numeric processing.

Some authors use the term *datastream* instead of *dataflow* to avoid confusion with *dataflow computing* or *dataflow architecture*, based on an *indeterministic machine paradigm*.

Dataflow programming was pioneered by Jack Dennis and his graduate students at MIT in the 1960s.
