# Functional reactive programming

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming

Functional reactive programming (FRP) is a programming paradigm for reactive programming (*asynchronous dataflow programming*) using the building blocks of functional programming (e.g. map, reduce, filter).

FRP has been used for programming GUIs, robotics, games, and music, aiming to simplify these problems by *explicitly modeling time*.

The original formulation of functional reactive programming can be found in the ICFP 97 paper Functional Reactive Animation by Conal Elliott and Paul Hudak.

FRP has taken many forms since its introduction in 1997. One axis of diversity is *discrete vs. continuous semantics*. Another axis is how FRP systems can be changed dynamically.
