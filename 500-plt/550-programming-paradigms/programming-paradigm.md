*Programming paradigms* are a way to classify programming languages based on their features, although a language usually belongs to more then one paradigm.

A paradigm is a distinct set of concepts and practices that define an approach to programming.

It may include a set of common patterns and models, distinguishing idioms, principles, guidelines and conventions, and relations to various mathematical theories (briefly, a "typical way of doing things").
