# CS :: PLT :: Programming Language Theory

This, PLT section, is about programming language theory. Firstly, it is about the properties and features common to almost all programming languages. However, the primary focus is on the languages based on lambda calculus and functional programming paradigm. The underlying theory of these languages is by far the most developed formalism across the PL board, certainly, in no small part because these languages are as close to the actual mathematical formalisms as programming laguages get. FPLs seems to form a sturdy base, a default approach for a PL implementation, the features of other programming paradigms can be modelled and build upon.
