# Arity

Arity is a property of many language constructs:
- number of items in a function *parameter list*; the most common case
- number of items in a function *argument list*
- number of *operands* an operation takes (rarely more then two)
- number of *tuple components* in an n-tuple, where n > 1
- number of *domains* in the Cartesian product (for relations)
- max number of *child nodes* that any node in a tree may have


Common arities:
- 0-ary, nullary
- 1-ary, unary
- 2-ary, binary
- 3-ary, terary
- 4-ary, quaternary
- poliadic, multary, arity > 1
- variadic, varying arity
- ∞-ary, anary, potentially infinite arity

English has two series of arities, functioning as *distributive numbers*: 
arity comes from Latin and adicity is from Ancient Greek. The Latinate series is frequently confused with ordinal numbers, as both end in the suffix "-ary". Distributive number is a word that answers the question "how many times each?" or "how many at a time?", e.g. singly, doubly, triply.

This is most significant for *quaternary* (arity, used for both) vs. *quartary* (ordinal) and *novenary* (arity) vs. *nonary* (ordinal, used for both).

However, this is more commonly expressed in the form of phrases such as "one by one", "two by two", then "one at a time", "two at a time", then "one of each", "two of each", then "in twos", "in threes", or using a word for counting, e.g. "in groups of two" or "two pieces to a data".

The Latinate series is used for names of the positional numeral systems with small bases (e.g. binary, ternary), but then the names have other forms from the base-8 onwards (so, it is, e.g., "octal" and not "octonary").


Terminology:
- arity (p. arities) is from Latin
- adicity (p. adicities) is from Ancient Greek
- adinity
- rank (math)
- degree (logic and philosophy)
- valency (linguistics)
