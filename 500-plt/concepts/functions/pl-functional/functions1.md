# Function

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)

* All functions are (subsets of) relations. A relation that is serial (left-total) and functional (right-unique) is a function. The most important property of functions is that an element in domain is associated with only one element in the codomain (right-unique)


* A function is a particular *relation* between *sets* that associates to every element of the *domain* (source) set exactly one element of the *codomain* (target) set.


**Total function**, or just function, must associates every single element in the domain. **Partial function** is allowed to be undefined for some domain elements; for example, division-related functions are not defined for number 0 as divisor: e.g. `f(1/x)=y` is undefined for `x=0`.

A function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs where each input is related to exactly one output. The input to a function is called the **argument** and the output is called the **value** (function value). The set of all permitted inputs to a given function is called the *domain* of the function, while the set of permissible outputs is called the *codomain*.

$$x \in X_{dom},\ y \in Y_{cod}, x\to y$$

relation: $$xRy$$ ("x is R-related to y")

function: $$⨑(x)=y$$

- mapping: ↦            x ↦ y
- partial mapping: ⇀    x ⇀ y
- composition:           g ∘ f


Functions are a proper subset of relations. To qualify as a function, a relation has to meet these properties:
- each (and every) element of the *domain* (source set) must be associated
- with at most one element of the *codomain* (target set)
- a function always gives the same output given the same input

This does not prevent the possibility that more than one element of the domain may be associated with the same element in the codomain:

$$x_1,x_2 \in X, y_1 \in Y$$ it can be that $$⨕(x_1)=y_1\ and\ ∮(x_2)=y_1$$

x ∈ X, y ∈ Y, f(x)=y 

: f(a)=z and f(b)=z


However, not all elements of the codomain have to be engaged


xRy: $$x \in X_{dom}, y \in Y_{cod}\ |\ xRy\ or\ R(x,y)$$

x ∈ X, y ∈ Y, f(x)=y


A function is relation that associates each element `x` of a set `X`, the domain of the function, to a single element `y` of a set `Y` (possibly the same set `X`), the codomain of the function.

$$x \in X_{dom} \to y \in Y_{cod}$$


If the function is called `f`, this relation is denoted `y = f (x)`, spoken as "f of x", the element `x` is the argument or input of the function, and `y` is the value of the function, the output, or the **image of `x` by `f`**.

The symbol that is used for representing the input is *the variable of the function*; one often says that `f` is a function of the variable `x`; e.g. if `x` represents time, it can be said that `f` is a function of time.

A function is uniquely represented by the set of all pairs (x, f (x)), called the graph of the function.[note 2] When the domain and the codomain are sets of real numbers, each such pair may be considered as the Cartesian coordinates of a point in the plane. The set of these points is called the graph of the function; it is a popular means to illustrate the function.

Functions are widely used in science, and in most fields of mathematics. It has been said that functions are "the central objects of investigation" in most fields of mathematics.[2]
