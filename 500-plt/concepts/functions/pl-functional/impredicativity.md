# Impredicativity

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impredicative

> A definition is impredicative if it uses a self-reference.

Roughly, a definition is impredicative if it invokes (mentions or quantifies over) the set being defined, or more commonly, another set that contains the thing being defined.

There is no formal definition of (im)predicativity, with different authors giving different but related definitions.
