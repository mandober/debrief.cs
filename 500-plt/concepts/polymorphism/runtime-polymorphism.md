# Runtime polymorphism

In C++, runtime polymorphism is realized using virtual functions.


## Runtime Polymorphism

Runtime polymorphism, also known as *dynamic method dispatch*, is a concept in OOP that allows a method to behave differently based on the type of object it is acting on. It is achieved through *method overriding*, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method to be executed is determined at runtime, allowing for more flexible and reusable code.
