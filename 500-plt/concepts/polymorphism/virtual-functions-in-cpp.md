# Virtual Functions in C++

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-function-cpp/

A *virtual function* (or virtual method) is a member function (i.e. a method) of the base class intended to be overridden in the derived classes.

When we refer to an instance (an object) of a derived class using a pointer or reference to the base class, we call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived class's version of the method.
