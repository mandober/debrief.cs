# Programming Language Theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory

**Programming language theory** (PLT) is a branch of CS that deals with
- design
- implementation
- analysis
- characterization
- classification
of formal languages known as programming languages (PLs) and of their individual features.

PLT falls within the discipline of computer science, depending on and affecting mathematics, software engineering, linguistics and even cognitive science.

## History

In some ways, the history of programming language theory predates even the development of programming languages themselves. The lambda calculus, developed by Alonzo Church and Stephen Cole Kleene in the 1930s, is considered by some to be the world's first FPL, even though it was intended to model computation rather than being a means for programmers to describe algorithms to a computer system. Many modern FPL have been described as providing a "thin veneer" over the lambda calculus, and many are easily described in terms of it.
