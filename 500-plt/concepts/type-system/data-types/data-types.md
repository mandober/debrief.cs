# Data types

In mathematics, we can define an infinite set of the natural numbers using ellipses, as in N = {0,1,2,...}, never rasing a question about the actual capacity needed to store such a set.

With the advent of computers that question was quickly raised. The introduction of computers have immediately created a tremendous problem: the data types of mathematics that were so easily and elegantly denoted, proved impossible to be faithfully represented. All attempts to fit even a countable infinity, let alone an innumerable one, into such a finitary device failed miserably (until the advancements in lazy evaluation strategy).

Expelled from mathematics for disrespecting the valid forms of reasoning, CS slowly established itself as the special discipline without the discipline of all of the discipline, but soon fell apart under the pressure of poorly solved and unsolved computer problems. The renown mathematical rigor, hailed for centuries, strengthened through suffering, self-deprivation and the strictness of the disciplines, through the thick and thin from the ancient lands to the dark ages, up to but not including the digital age, for it was the first CS' kill. The rigor died for anxiety and prayer, paradox and superstition primed the reproducibility of successful computing environment, swapping strictness for finickiness.
