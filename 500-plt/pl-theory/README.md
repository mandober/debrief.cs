# CS :: Programming Language Theory

This section, `500-plt`, is about *Programming Language Theory* or the *Theory Programming Languages*.

Primarily, it tries to index and describe common and then the less common language features, particularly focusing on the well-understood and generally accepted solutions and implementations of various challenges pertaining to programming language design.

In parallel, this section analyses various aspects of lambda calculus in its untyped and typed variants, especially in relation to type theory and augmentation of LC with advanced typing features such as type functions, polymorphism, dependent types. These features are also investigated form themselves, and with regard to their implementation across various PLs, particularly focusing on the functional programming paradigm, with description of other programming paradigms as well.

The strong focus on functional programming languages (FPLs) is due to the fact that these languages are as close to the actual mathematical formalisms as programming laguages get. They form a sturdy base, presenting themselves as a default base layer for the development and implementation of a programming language, especially since features of other programming paradigms can be modelled and build upon them. Comprehending and reasoning about a program writen in a functional PL is far easier than analysing the same program writen in an imperative PL where it is difficult to follow the changes of program state. FPL's semantics can be expressed in the language of mathematics, thus FPLs make an ideal subject of the study of PLs in general.
