# Class

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)

In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is an abstraction that brings together objects that share very similar properties and behaviour. If a programming task required modelling a bunch of independent but almost identical objects, one could approach this problem by coding the attributes and behaviour of a single object. Then the same code is bound to be copied to model the other objects, probably frequently making small changes in the code to account for tiny discrepancies between the objects.


In many languages, the class name is used as the name for the class (the template itself), the name for the default constructor of the class (a subroutine that creates objects), and as the type of objects generated by instantiating the class; these distinct concepts are easily conflated.

When an object is created by a constructor of the class, the resulting object is called an instance of the class, and the member variables specific to the object are called instance variables, to contrast with the class variables shared across the class.

In some languages, classes are only a compile-time feature (new classes cannot be declared at run-time), while in other languages classes are first-class citizens, and are generally themselves objects (typically of type Class or similar). In these languages, a class that creates classes is called a metaclass.
