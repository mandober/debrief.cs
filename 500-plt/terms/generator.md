# Generator

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_(computer_science)

In computer science, a generator is a routine that can be used to control the iteration behaviour of a loop. All generators are also iterators. A generator is very similar to a function that returns an array, in that a generator has parameters, can be called, and generates a sequence of values.
