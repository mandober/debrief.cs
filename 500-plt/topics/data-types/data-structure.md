# Data structure

## Structures in math

Generally, a **mathematical structure** is a *carrier set* (underlying set) *endowed* with a *set of features* (operations, relations, metric, topology, etc.) that are related or attached to the set, enhancing it in some way; moreover, the carrier set and its feature set must together satisfy a particular *set of axioms*.

> mathematical structure = carrier set + operations + axioms

For instance, an algebraic structure consists of a nonempty carrier set, a set of operations on the set, and a set of axioms that the set and operations must satisfy.


## Structures in CS

> data structure = data + operations

A *data structure* is a collection of data organized in an optimal way with regards to the intended use, together with the set of operations that work on that structure.

A *data type* is a set of related values; optionally, the concept of the data type may also assume an effective representation, and a set of operations on that type, but in that case it may also be called a data structure. Come to think about it, a data type *is* a data structure.

Unlike mathematical structures, data types/structures usually (at least in most popular imperative PLs) lack a set of axioms to uphold, thereby actively ignoring the notion of correct programming.
