# PLT :: Functions

The topic of functions is enormous, 
proliferating in all the areas of math and spreading across sciences.

. The notion of function is fundamental in both mathematics and computer science, particularly in Programming Language Theory.

and almost all math and CS areas/sections have functions or some function-like notion. Functions are first described in set theory where functions are actually sets.
