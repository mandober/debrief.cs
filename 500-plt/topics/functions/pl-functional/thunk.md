# Thunk

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk

A thunk is a function, or more generally, a subroutine, used to inject an additional calculation into another function. Frequently, a thunk is a nullary function, used to delay a calculation until its result becomes necessary, thus providing a way to introduce laziness in an eagerly-evaluated language. Thunks are also used to insert computations at the start/end of another function. Thunks have a variety of applications in compiler code generation and modular programming.
