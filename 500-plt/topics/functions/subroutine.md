A subroutine is just a means of extracting a partion of code, out of the usual, top to bottom, program flow, and, most importantly, to be able to name that group. 

Being able to form a separate, named, code unit as a group that gathers together code lines needed to perform a certain functionality is the 


with the ability to name that group, which then allows the programmer to refer to it later by the name.


A subroutine is a grouping of related functionality in a PL, with the benefit that the lines of code can be named as a group

A subroutine is the fundamental means of abstraction in a PL. 


A subroutine is a sequence of program instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit.

This unit can then be used in programs wherever that particular task should be performed.



Subroutines may be defined within programs, or separately in libraries that can be used by many programs. In different programming languages, a subroutine may be called a routine, subprogram, function, method, or procedure. Technically, these terms all have different definitions, and the nomenclature varies from language to language. The generic umbrella term callable unit is sometimes used.

The name *subprogram* suggests a subroutine behaves in much the same way as a computer program that is used as one step in a larger program or another subprogram. A subroutine is often coded so that it can be started several times and from several places during one execution of the program, including from other subroutines, and then branch back (return) to the next instruction after the call, once the subroutine's task is done.

The *idea of subroutines* was initially conceived by John Mauchly during his work on ENIAC, and recorded in a *January 1947* Harvard symposium on "Preparation of Problems for EDVAC-type Machines".

Maurice Wilkes, David Wheeler, and Stanley Gill are generally credited with the *formal invention of the concept of subroutines*, which they termed a *closed subroutine*, contrasted with an *open subroutine* or *macro*. 

However, *Alan Turing had discussed subroutines in a paper of 1945* on design proposals for the NPL ACE, going so far as to invent the concept of a *return address stack*.


Subroutines are a powerful programming tool, and the syntax of many programming languages includes support for writing and using them.

Judicious use of subroutines (for example, through the structured programming approach) will often substantially reduce the cost of developing and maintaining a large program, while increasing its quality and reliability.

Subroutines, often collected into libraries, are an important mechanism for sharing and trading software.

The discipline of object-oriented programming is based on objects and methods (which are subroutines attached to these objects or object classes).
