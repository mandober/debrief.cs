In programming languages, **first-class values** (or first-class citizens) are language entities that enjoy all or most privileges a language offers.

The usual set of privileges includes:
- can be passed into a function as an argument
- can be returned from a function as a value
- can be stored in data structures (can constitute a list/array)
- are assignable to a variable

Functions are often talked about whether they are first-class value in a given language. In addition to the usual set of privileges, some programming language theorists require that a language also supports anonymous functions (function literals) for functions to be deemed first-class citizens.

In languages with first-class functions, the names of functions do not have any special status; they are treated like ordinary variables with a function type.
