# Distinguishing features

- Algol 60: nested block structures
- Algol 60: lexical scoping
- Lisp: garbage collection
- Lisp: first-class functions
- Lisp: cloures
- Haskell: type classes
- Clean: uniqueness types
- Rust: affine types
- Rust: ownership of values
- Rust: borrowing of values
- Rust: lifetime of references
- Agda/Idris: dependent types
- Haskell: monads
- Haskell: I/O management with monads
- Haskell: management of side effects with monads
- Haskell: laziness, lazy evaluation



Grounbreaking features in PL design and the languages that first introduced it, often becoming famous for it, sometimes even synonymous with it.

Languages that showcase a particular feature in an especially favorable way (perhaps by sporting the most optimal and/or the most comfortable way for working with it) are mentioned as the feature's champions (even when they didn't introduce it first - along with the language that did).

And now for some game of associations:


A) Lisp
B) Haskell
C) Clean
D) Rust
E) Agda/Idris

Garbage collection
Uniqueness types
Dependent types
First-class functions
cloures
Affine types
Ownership (of values)
Borrowing  (of values)
Lifetimes (of references)
Type classes (overloading)
Monads
Managing side effects with monads
Non-strict evaluation
