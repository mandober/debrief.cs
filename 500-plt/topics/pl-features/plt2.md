# Programming Language Theory

__Programming language theory__ (PLT) is a CS branch that studies programming languages and their individual features, including:
- design
- implementation
- analysis
- characterization
- classification


## PLT disciplines

PLT as a CS discipline (without the discipline of all of the discipline) depends on and affects software engineering, linguistics and mathematics, especially math branches like computability theory, category theory, set theory.

Many math and CS fields belong to, or exert a profound influence on PLT:
- Formal semantics
- Type theory
- Program analysis and transformation
- Comparative programming language analysis
- Generic and metaprogramming
- Domain-specific languages
- Compiler construction
- Run-time systems


__Formal semantics__ is the formal specification of the behaviour of computer programs and programming languages. 3 approaches to describe semantics:
1. Denotational semantics
2. Operational semantics
3. Axiomatic semantics

*Type theory* studies type systems. Type systems are tractable syntactic method for proving the absence of certain program behaviors by classifying phrases according to the kinds of values they compute. Many PLs are distinguished by the characteristics of their type systems.

_Program analysis_ is the general problem of examining a program and determining key characteristics (such as the absence of classes of program errors).

_Program transformation_ is the process of transforming a program in one form (language) to another form.

_Comparative programming language analysis_ seeks to classify programming languages into different types based on their characteristics; broad categories of programming languages are often known as programming paradigms.

Generic and metaprogramming
_Metaprogramming_ is the generation of higher-order programs which, when executed, produce programs (possibly in a different language, or in a subset of the original language) as a result.

_Domain-specific languages_ are languages constructed to efficiently solve problems of a particular part of domain.

__Compiler theory__, the theory of compiler construction, deals with translation of programs between PLs.

__Runtime systems__ refers to the development of PL runtime environments and their components, including VMs, GC and FFI.
