# Semantics

Programming Language Theory (PLT) is a mathematical study of programs and programming languages.

There are 3 aspects of a programming language
- syntax
- semantics
- pragmatics

Syntax deals with concrete representation, alphabet of symbols that a PL uses to express meaning.

Semantics is the meaning that syntax tries to convey. 
Semantics is about the meaning of programs. 

The goal of PLT is finding ways to describe program behaviors that are both precise and abstract: *precise* so that we can use mathematical tools to formalize and check interesting properties; *abstract* so that properties of interest can be discussed clearly, without loosing ourselves in low-level details.

To prove specific properties of particular programs, i.e. program verification. Important in some domains (safety-critical systems, hardware design, security protocols, inner loops of key algorithms), but still quite difficult and expensive.

To develop intuitions for informal reasoning about programs.

To prove general facts about all the programs in a given programming language (e.g., safety or isolation properties).

To understand language features (and their interactions) deeply and develop principles for better language design (PL is the "materials science" of CS).
