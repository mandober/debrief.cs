* From a lower-level view, a PL is a notational system designed to issue instructions to a computer in order to accomplish a particular task.
* From a higher-level perspective, a PL serves to express an algorithm that accomplishes a particular task; this high-level description is then automatically translated into low-level computer instructions by the compiler.
* Programming languages are formal languages.
* Syntax and semantics are the most fundamental aspects of a PL.
