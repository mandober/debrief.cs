# Programming languages debrief

* A programming language is a formal language used to convey and approximate a concept to a computer. More practically, it is a way to relay instructions to a computer.

* A formal language is a set of finite strings obtained by concatenating the letters of its alphabet.

* Programming languages are intended to provide abstractions of the machine code; of machine code in general and any specific machine language in particular for it is next to impossible to program in it.

* Higher-level abstractions model the computation in a way that is easier for us to reason about. They also provide a programming model that is independent of any concrete underlying computer architecture.

* Although it is useful to base PLs on mathematical formalisms, strangly, this was rarely the case. Majority of PLs are not mathematical formalisms but they are transformation systems for conveying concepts from an informal system (the thoughts of the programmer) into an engineering formalism (the machine code).

* It is a very common misconception that a "better" programming language is th eone with a lower learning barrier. Why should this be the case?! PLs are a big part of computer science and, like any science, this one also requires education and years of learning the related theory. Programming should not be for anybody, at least, critical, even important, programming. Just like striving for low entry barrier, promoting the idea that keeping the number of abstractions low is beneficial for beginners is misplaced - PLs shouls not attempt to attrack people to programming and offer low conceptual overhead. PLs should be as hard and unapproachable as required to write corret program. Speed is nothing is the program is not correct. The only meaningful feature of a PL is not speed, learning effort (which should be as hard as required), community, tooling, purity, immutability, shit and giggles, no; the only important thing is whether it produces provably correct code. Only then it makes sense to talk about other "features". Brand New Feature: Inacurate Incorrect but Improvable Programming. Mathematically provable code correctness (MPCC). This just in: *Language as a theory, functions as theorems (LT/FT)*. "The article, just like PLs, produces results without backing them up with a proof". New mottol *Prouve le!*. Show me the proof! Montrer la preuve! Verification, validation, specification, proof (Poof!)
