# Term rewriting system

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_rewriting_system

A **term rewriting system (TRS)** is a *rewriting system* whose objects are terms, which are expressions with nested sub-expressions. For example, the system shown under § Logic above is a term rewriting system. The terms in this system are composed of binary operators {\displaystyle (\vee )}(∨) and {\displaystyle (\wedge )}(∧) and the unary operator {\displaystyle (\neg )}(¬). Also present in the rules are variables, which represent any possible term (though a single variable always represents the same term throughout a single rule).

In contrast to string rewriting systems, whose objects are sequences of symbols, the objects of a term rewriting system form a term algebra. A term can be visualized as a tree of symbols, the set of admitted symbols being fixed by a given signature.
