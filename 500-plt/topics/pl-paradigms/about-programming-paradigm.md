# About programming paradigms

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm

>**Programming paradigms** are a way to classify programming languages based on a presence of a set of features considered to characterize a certain paradigm.

A programming paradigm is a name for a completely arbitrary set of features, some of which were determined by customs, tradition and convention, some by law and ceremony, whiel some were spawned out of desperation and wishful thinking of language authors and enchanted aficionados. People tend to form strong opinions about their beloved language. The more time one uses the same language, the harder one admits its undeniable shortcomings. [oooh, you doublethinking rascal! Oh dear, said Georgiana, looking consternated: All rant and no coding makes Jack's constipation anticipated. Ramble on you silver-tongued chronofuck, why doncha. Rant rant rant ahead, bent but steady stream, your beloved language is merely merely merely a steaming pile of dream].

Grouping languages by paradigms is usually an extremelly inaccurate classification which may only serve as a rough guideline.


although many languages sport more then one paradigm.

A paradigm is a distinct set of concepts and practices that define an approach to programming.

It may include a set of common patterns and models, distinguishing idioms, principles, guidelines and conventions, and relations to various mathematical theories (briefly, a "typical way of doing things").




## Fundamental features

What are some of these fundamental features that define paradigms?

Paradigm-defining features
- mutation
- side-effects
- statements v expressions
- null v option data type
- loops v recursion
- class, object, interface, trait, mixin v
  ADT, function, type class
- algebraic data types, esp. sum types
- functional (FP) v relational style (LP)
- decoupled data and behaviour
  - decoupling data from behaviour
  - carrier data type and its methods
  - of data types from their behaviours
  - object tightly couples data and behaviour
  - expression problem
    - extensibility of data and behaviour w/o refactoring
      (adding new method, adding new data variant)
