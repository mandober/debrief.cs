# Algebraic Dynamic Programming

Algebraic Dynamic Programming (ADP) is a new method to design and implement, tune, test and teach Dynamic Programming algorithms. Compared to the traditional style, ADP provides a much higher level of abstraction, helping to solve more sophisticated problems with better chances of success.

*ADP-Advanced*: Advanced Techniques in ADP are these that extend the ADP core concepts of evaluation algebra and yield parsers in some direction. All these techniques are used in ADP-Applications, but here they are explained from a methodical point of view.

*ADP-Compiler*: The ADP compiler translates ADP programs to (optimized) ADP, to C, and into traditional DP recurrences typeset in LaTeX.

*ADP-HMM*: There is much correspondence between HMMs (hidden markov models) and Dynamic Programming. However, the terminologies used in these two areas are quite distinct. Here we present the use of ADP with probabilistic algebras and their relation to HMMs and stochastic context-free grammars
