# Page description language

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_description_language

In digital printing, a **page description language (PDL)** describes the appearance of a printed page using a higher-level abstraction than the actual bitmap printout (which is the base level, lacking abstraction).

PostScript is one of the most noted page description languages. The markup language adaptation of the PDL is the page description markup language.
