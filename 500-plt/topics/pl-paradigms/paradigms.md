Paradigms in programming languages

Once upon a time, early PLs were influenced by the assembly languages and their liberal use of jumps, so programmers mimicked that style, sprinkling the code with GOTO commands, making the code hard to read and understand. That conflict about the code organization and structuring, i.e. *unstructured vs structural programming paradigm*, has long passed, and the structured approach, being more reasonable, won. Instead of letting the GOTO command available to programmers and hoping it will be used judiciously to their best abilities, the command was moved from the (most) PLs to the compilers.






the main concern was that the PLs did not offer ways to express the structure of the code in a reasonable way.

code was unstructured: scattered statements, decreasing the possibility to understand it down to a minimum.
