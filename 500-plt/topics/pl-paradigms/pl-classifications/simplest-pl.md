# PLT :: Simplest PL

## The simplest programming language

The question of which programming language is the simplest should be considered fairly, so only languages independent of a higher-level host environment, and those that do not require the presence of another language should be considered. See? CS is hard, we cannot even come up with a decent definition of a simple language. Nevermind; following the best writing practices we'll appeal to the reader's intuition (and by we I mean me, and by readers I mean me). In other words, failing to provide a definition, a simple PL can only be whatever I imagine it to be. And we do mean proper, close to the metal, programming language. You know what? Forgetabouit, we'll wing it as we go, by now I have twice forgotten what I've even needed the definition of a simple PL for.

Besides a large number of esoteric programming languages, some of which are famous for their conciseness
