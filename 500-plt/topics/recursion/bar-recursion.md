# Bar recursion

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_recursion

Bar recursion is a generalized form of recursion developed by C. Spector in his 1962 paper.

`Provably recursive functionals of analysis: a consistency proof of analysis by an extension of principles in current intuitionistic mathematics`, C. Spector, 1962. In F.D.E.Dekker (ed.). Recursive Function Theory: Proc. Symposia in Pure Mathematics. Vol. 5. American Mathematical Society.

It is related to *bar induction* in the same fashion that *primitive recursion* is related to *ordinary induction*, or *transfinite recursion* is related to *transfinite induction*.
