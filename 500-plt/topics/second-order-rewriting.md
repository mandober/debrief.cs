# Second-Order Rewriting

from the paper: "Theory and Practice of Second-Order Rewriting: Foundation, Evolution, and SOL" by Makoto Hamana

(`paper: abstract`) Overview of the theory and practice of second-order rewriting. *Second-order rewriting* methods have been demonstrated as useful and applicable to important notions of PLs such as logic programming, algebraic effects, quantum computation, cyclic computation. We explain foundation and evolution of second-order rewriting by presenting *the framework of second-order computation systems*. We also demonstrate our system SOL of second-order laboratory through various programming language examples.
