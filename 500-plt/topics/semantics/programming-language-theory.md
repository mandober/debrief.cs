# Programming Language Theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory

Programming Language Theory (PLT) is a branch of CS that studies the class of formal languages called programming languages and their features. PLT studies their design, implementation, analysis, properties, classification, paradigms, and more. PLT is a CS discipline but it depends on and is affected by math, software engineering, linguistics, and even cognitive science.

## History of PLT

The history of PLT predates even the emergence of programming languages: the lambda calculus, created by Alonzo Church in the 1930s as a formal theory of functions, was originally intended as a model of computation, but then it become a lot more and is considered as the world's first FPL. Many FPLs build additional features around the lambda calculus at their core. Many PLs in general may be described in terms of it, because lambda calculi and Turing Machines are equivalent models of computation. While TMs take a more imperative pedal-to-the-metal approach, Î»-calculi use the more sane and human-friendlier declarative paradigm.
