**The structured program theorem** (Böhm–Jacopini theorem) states that a class of control flow graphs (flowcharts) can compute any *computable function* if it combines subprograms using only 3 specific control structures:
1. **Sequence**: executing subprograms one after the other
2. **Selection**: executing a subprograms depending on a boolean expression
3. **Iteration**: repeatedly executing a subprogram while boolean expr is true
