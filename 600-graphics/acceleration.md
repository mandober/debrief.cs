# Acceleration

Using just position and velocity vectors we can only describe *linear motion*. No matter the magnitude and direction of the velocity vector, the motion will be linear.

>Velocity is the change in position over time.

In order to achieve freer motion, we need to introduce acceleration.

>Acceleration is the change in velocity over time.

So acceleration will affect velocity, and velocity will affect position. This is the elementary setup of achieving motion, which can be made more complicated by introducing additional forces like gravity, friction, stiction, air resistance, etc., as well as introducing object properties that can affect, peraphs not motion as much as collisions, such as elasticity and mass.

Acceleration is also represented as a vector with x and y components, `acc_x` and `acc_y`.
