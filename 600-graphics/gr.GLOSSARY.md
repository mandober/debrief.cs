# Graphic :: Glossary


## All points addressable
All points addressable (APA), or pixel addressable, in the context of a dot matrix on a display device consisting of a pixel array, refers to an arrangement whereby bits or cells can be individually manipulated, as opposed to rewriting the whole array, or regions such as characters, every time a change is needed.

## Box-drawing characters
Box-drawing characters, also known as line-drawing characters, are a form of semigraphics widely used in text user interfaces to draw various geometric frames and boxes. These characters are characterized by being designed to be connected horizontally and/or vertically with adjacent characters, which requires proper alignment. Box-drawing characters therefore typically only work well with monospaced fonts.

## Charset
Character encoding (character set, charset) is the process of assigning numbers to graphical characters, especially the written characters of human language, allowing them to be stored, transmitted, and transformed using digital computers. The numerical values that make up a character encoding are known as *code points* and collectively comprise a *code space*, a *code page*, or a *character map*.

## Code page 437
Code page 437 (`CCSID 437`) is the character set of the original IBM PC (personal computer). It is also known as `CP437`, `OEM-US`, `OEM 437`, `PC-8`, or `DOS Latin US`. The set includes all printable ASCII characters as well as some accented letters (diacritics), Greek letters, icons, and line-drawing symbols. It is sometimes referred to as the *OEM font* or *high ASCII*, or as *extended ASCII* (one of many mutually incompatible ASCII extensions).

## CCSID
A CCSID (coded character set identifier) is a 16-bit number that represents a particular encoding of a specific code page. For example, Unicode is a code page that has several character encoding schemes (transformation forms), including UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32, but which may or may not actually be accompanied by a CCSID number to indicate that this encoding is being used.

## CJK characters
In internationalization, CJK characters is a collective term for graphemes used in the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean writing systems, which each include Chinese characters. The term CJKV also includes Vietnamese, which was also historically written with Chinese characters.

## Dot matrix
A dot matrix is a 2-dimensional patterned array, used to represent characters, symbols and images. Most types of modern technology use dot matrices for display of information, including mobile phones, televisions, and printers.

## Extended ASCII
Extended ASCII is a repertoire of character encodings that include (most of) the original 96 ASCII character set, plus up to 128 additional characters. There is no formal definition of "extended ASCII", and even use of the term is sometimes criticized, because it can be mistakenly interpreted to mean that the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) had updated its standard to include more characters, or that the term identifies a single unambiguous encoding, neither of which is the case.

## Ideographic
An ideogram or ideograph is a symbol that represents an idea or concept independent of any particular language. Some ideograms are more arbitrary than others: some are only meaningful assuming preexisting familiarity with some convention; others more directly resemble their signifieds. Ideograms that represent physical objects by visually resembling them are called pictograms.

## OEM code page
The OEM code pages (original equipment manufacturer) are used by Win32 console applications, and by virtual DOS, and can be considered a holdover from DOS and the original IBM PC architecture. A separate suite of code pages was implemented not only due to compatibility, but also because the fonts of VGA (and descendant) hardware suggest encoding of line-drawing characters to be compatible with *code page 437*. Most OEM code pages share many code points, particularly for non-letter characters, with the second (non-ASCII) half of *CP437*.

## Pictographic
Ideograms that represent physical objects by visually resembling them are called pictograms.

## Raster graphic
A raster graphic represents a two-dimensional picture as a rectangular matrix or grid of pixels, viewable via a computer display, paper, or other display medium. A raster is technically characterized by the width and height of the image in pixels and by the number of bits per pixel. Raster images are stored in image files with varying dissemination, production, generation, and acquisition formats.

## Raw image file
A camera raw image file contains unprocessed (or minimally processed) data from the image sensor of either a digital camera, a motion picture film scanner, or other image scanner. Raw files are so named because they are not yet processed, and contain large amounts of potentially redundant data. Normally, the image is processed by a raw converter, in a wide-gamut internal color space where precise adjustments can be made before conversion to a viewable file format such as JPEG or PNG for storage, printing, or further manipulation.

## Sixel
Sixel, short for "6 pixels", is a bitmap graphics format supported by terminals and printers from DEC. It consists of a pattern six pixels high and one wide, resulting in 64 possible patterns. Each possible pattern is assigned an ASCII character, making the sixels easy to transmit on 7-bit serial links.

## Semigraphics
Text-based semigraphics, pseudographics, or character graphics is a primitive method used in early text mode video hardware to emulate raster graphics without having to implement the logic for such a display mode.

## Vector graphic
Vector graphics are a form of computer graphics in which visual images are created directly from geometric shapes defined on a Cartesian plane, such as points, lines, curves and polygons.

## VGA
Video Graphics Array (VGA) is a video display controller and accompanying graphics standard, first introduced with the IBM PS/2 line of computers in 1987, which became ubiquitous in the IBM PC compatible industry within three years. The term now refers to the computer display standard, the 15-pin D-subminiature VGA connector, or the resolution characteristic of the VGA hardware.
