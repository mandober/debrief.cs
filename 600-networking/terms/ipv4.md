# IPv4

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4

- IPv4 address space: 32-bit
- number of unique hosts: 4,294,967,296 (2^32)
- reserves address blocks for 
  - private networks, ~18 million
  - multicast addresses, ~270 million
- connectionless protocol, best effort delivery model (does not guarantee delivery, nor proper sequencing, nor avoidance of duplicate delivery; that is handled by an upper layer transport protocol such as TCP)
- quad-dotted address, 0.0.0.0, each group has 8 bits, ranging (dec): 0-255

Classful description


Dedicated space for carrier-grade NAT deployment:
    100.64.0.0/10
    100.64.0.0 - 100.127.255.255
    netmask 255.192.0.0
This address block should not be used on private networks or on the public Internet.
The size of the address block: 2^22, ~4 million
