# Position

Traditionally, we'd think of position as a point in a (Cartesian) coordinate system, so defined in terms of a point `(x, y)`. This is valid, but we can also think about *position as a vector* since vectors can also be defined in terms of a point - that point is then a vector's terminal point, while its initial point is implicitly at the origin.
