# Mechanics :: Vectors in graphics

A vector is graphical (geometrical) elements with magnitude and direction, and we can also talk about the angle the vec subtends with an axis (commonly, with the x-axis).

In general, angles are often considered in the *standard position*: the initial ray of the angle needs to be placed on the x-axis with its vertex at the origin. Then a positive angle has its terminal ray going ccw, and a negative angle's terminal rayt goes cw.

The standard way of representing vectors is by a single point (considered as the vector's head), with the other point (vector's tail) at the origin.

Since a vector can be defined by a point, the fact that a point can be described in two different ways (Cartesian coordinate system and polar coordinate syatem) translates to vectors too. Thus, a vector can be defined by a point as `(x, y)` or `(r, Î¸)`.

Many things can be represented by vectors including position, velocity, accelaration.
