# Firewall

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)

A **firewall** is a *network security system* that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted one, such as the Internet.

Firewalls are stateful and stateless.
