# Types of networks by area

LAN is a separate network, with private IP address unroutable on Internet. It makes sense to have this term. But all the other "X Area Network" terms seem ridiculous as there is a name now for a network in any imaginable space. Additionally, all these networks are nonsensically divided into wired and wireless variants, like that particularly matters. Basically, no one knows what is the difference between a PAN and BAN.
