## IEEE 802
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802

`IEEE 802` is a family of IEEE standards for
- local area networks (LANs)
- personal area networks (PANs)
- metropolitan area networks (MANs)

The IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee (LMSC) maintains these standards.

The IEEE 802 family of standards has had *24 members*, numbered
- 802.1 through
- â€¦
- 802.24

with a working group of the LMSC devoted to each. However, not all of these working groups are currently active.

The IEEE 802 standards are restricted to *computer networks* carrying *variable-size packets*, unlike *cell relay networks*, for example, in which data is transmitted in short, uniformly sized units called *cells*. *Isochronous signal networks*, in which data is transmitted as a steady stream of octets, or groups of octets, at regular time intervals, are also outside the scope of the IEEE 802 standards.

The number 802 has no significance: it was simply the next number in the sequence that the IEEE used for standards projects.

The services and protocols specified in IEEE 802 map to the lower two layers (data link and physical) of the 7 layer Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) networking reference model.

IEEE 802 divides the OSI *data link layer* into two sub-layers:
- Logical Link Control (LLC)
- Medium Access Control (MAC)
as follows:
- Data link layer
  - LLC sublayer
  - MAC sublayer
- Physical layer

Everything above LLC is explicitly out of scope for IEEE 802 (as "upper layer protocols", presumed to be parts of equally non-OSI Internet reference model).

The most widely used standards are for
- Ethernet
- Bridging and Virtual Bridged LANs
- Wireless LAN
- Wireless PAN
- Wireless MAN
- Wireless Coexistence
- Media Independent Handover Services
- Wireless RAN

## IEEE 802.11

`IEEE 802.11` is part of the `IEEE 802` set of local area network (LAN) technical standards, and specifies the set of medium access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) protocols for implementing wireless local area network (WLAN) computer communication.

The standard and amendments provide the basis for wireless network products using the Wi-Fi brand and are the world's most widely used wireless computer networking standards.

IEEE 802.11 is used in most home and office networks to allow laptops, printers, smartphones, and other devices to communicate with each other and access the Internet without connecting wires. IEEE 802.11 is also a basis for vehicle-based communication networks with `IEEE 802.11p`.

The standards are created and maintained by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) LAN/MAN Standards Committee (IEEE 802). The base version of the standard was released in 1997 and has had subsequent amendments. While each amendment is officially revoked when it is incorporated in the latest version of the standard, the corporate world tends to market to the revisions because they concisely denote the capabilities of their products. As a result, in the marketplace, each revision tends to become its own standard. 802.11x is a shorthand for "any version of 802.11", to avoid confusion with "802.11" used specifically for the original 1997 version.

IEEE 802.11 uses various frequencies including, but not limited to, 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz, and 60 GHz frequency bands. Although IEEE 802.11 specifications list channels that might be used, the allowed radio frequency spectrum availability varies significantly by regulatory domain.

The protocols are typically used in conjunction with IEEE 802.2, and are designed to interwork seamlessly with Ethernet, and are very often used to carry Internet Protocol traffic.
