# Cellular network

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_network

A *cellular network* or *mobile network* is a communication network where the link to and from end nodes is wireless. The network is distributed over land areas called "cells", each served by at least one fixed-location transceiver (typically 3 cell sites or base transceiver stations). These base stations provide the cell with the network coverage which can be used for transmission of voice, data, and other types of content. A cell typically uses a different set of frequencies from neighboring cells, to avoid interference and provide guaranteed service quality within each cell.

When joined together, these cells provide radio coverage over a wide geographic area. This enables numerous portable transceivers (mobile phones, tablets and laptops equipped with mobile broadband modems, pagers, etc.) to communicate with each other and with fixed transceivers and telephones anywhere in the network, via base stations, even if some of the transceivers are moving through more than one cell during transmission.

Cellular networks offer a number of desirable features:
- More capacity than a single large transmitter, since the same frequency can be used for multiple links as long as they are in different cells.
- Mobile devices use less power than with a single transmitter or satellite since the cell towers are closer.
- Larger coverage area than a single terrestrial transmitter, since additional cell towers can be added indefinitely and are not limited by the horizon.
- Capability of utilizing higher frequency signals (more bandwidth and faster data rates) that are not able to propagate at long distances.
- With data compression and multiplexing, several video and audio channels may travel through a higher frequency signal on a single wideband carrier.

Major telecommunications providers have deployed voice and data cellular networks over most of the inhabited land area of Earth. This allows mobile phones and mobile computing devices to be connected to the public switched telephone network and public Internet access. Private cellular networks can be used for research or for large organizations.
