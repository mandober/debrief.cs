# Personal Unblocking Key

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_unblocking_key

Personal Unblocking Key (PUK), rarely Personal Unblocking Code (PUC), is used in SIM cards to reset a Personal Identification Number (PIN).

Almost all mobile phones offer the possibility of PIN protection: the user sets it up by choosing a 4-8 digit number which becomes their secret PIN code. With the PIN security function active, engaging with the phone requires entering the PIN. The user must enter the correct PIN to unlock the SIM card and connect to the mobile network. Without this, most network-related functionality (calls, messages, mobile data, USSD codes, etc.), are not available, save for emergency calls which are always avilable, even without the SIM card.

There are 3 chances to get the PIN right. If the wrong PIN is entered the 3rd time, the SIM card becomes locked. To unlock it, the user must enter the PUK code provided by the mobile service provider (usually printed on the SIM card's packaging).

After the correct PUK code is entered, the PIN must be reset. If the wrong PUK is entered 10 times in a row, the SIM card becomes permanently locked, blocked beyond recovery (sure sure), requiring a replacement.
