A SIM card (Subscriber Identity/Identification Module) is an IC intended to securely store the IMSI number and its related key, which are used to identify and authenticate subscribers on mobile telephony devices.

Technically the actual physical card is known as a UICC; this smart card is usually made of PVC with embedded contacts and semiconductors, with the SIM as its primary component. In practice the term "SIM card" refers to the entire unit and not just the IC.

SIM info contents:
- ICCID             (19 digits)
- IMSI              (15 digits)
- ACC               (4 digits)
- Káµ¢                (32 hex digits)
- OTA install key   (32 hex digits)
- PIN1              (4 digits)
- PIN2              (4 digits)
- PUK1              (8 digits)
- PUK2              (8 digits)
- ADM1 key          (8 digits)

A SIM contains a ICCID, IMSI number, security authentication and ciphering information, temporary information related to the local network, a list of the services the user has access to, and two passwords: a PIN for ordinary use, and a PUK for PIN unlocking. In Europe, the serial SIM number (SSN) is also sometimes accompanied by an IAN or a EAN required when registering online for the subscription of a prepaid card. It is also possible to store contact information on many SIM cards.

SIMs are always used on GSM phones; for CDMA phones, they are needed only for LTE-capable handsets. SIM cards can also be used in satellite phones, smart watches, computers, or cameras.

The first SIM cards were the size of a credit card; the size was reduced several times over the years, usually keeping electrical contacts the same, so that a larger card could be cut down to a smaller size.

SIMs are transferable between different mobile devices by removing the card itself. eSIM is replacing physical SIM cards in some domains, including cellular telephony. eSIM uses a software-based SIM embedded into an unremovable eUICC.

The SIM card is a type of smart card, the basis for which is the silicon integrated circuit chip.
