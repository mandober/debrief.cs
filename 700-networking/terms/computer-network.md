## Prelude

A computer network is a set of interconnected computers, a set of communications protocols that all devices on the network use to communicate with each other, and a set of shared resources located on or provided by the network nodes.

All computers on a network use a common communication protocols over digital interconnections and are arranged in a variety of network topologies. These interconnections are made up of telecommunication network technologies that use physical media such as wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency.

The *nodes of a computer network* are called *hosts* and each one is identified by at least one numerical network address (basically, a 32-bit in IPv4 and/or 128-bit number in IPv6), possibly also associated with a hostname.

The nodes of a computer network include personal computer stations, servers, printers, network hardware (routers, gateways, access points, firewalls, etc.) and other general-purpose or specialised devices.

The IP address is the primary identifier of a host on a network, while *hostnames* are redundant identifiers intended for human consumption. A hostname is a textual label (i.e. a memorable name because humans remember text far more easier then long numbers), for a node, and it rarely changed after the initial assignment. This has the additional benefit that the associated numerical address may change while the hostname remains the same.

Network addresses are numbers (long bit-strings) intended for machine use and they serve for locating and identifying the nodes on a network by using a communication protocol such as the Internet Protocol.

Computer networks may be classified by many criteria, including the transmission medium used to carry signals, bandwidth, communications protocols to organize network traffic, the network size, the topology, traffic control mechanism, organizational intent, etc.
