# IP address

Internet Protocol address, i.e. **IP address**, is a binary number that uniquely identifies a host on a network.

Network is a relative term - there are private networks, variously called PAN/CAN/MAN, but usualy just local area networks (LANs), which are connected (via routers) into bigger and bigger networks, at some point becomming public, and in the end comprising the Internet. Most importantly, each network is clearly demarcated (using the IP addresses), with its smallest segments governed by routers as the most important of cross- and inter-networking devices.

In a LAN, each host is commonly assigned an IP address from a private, publically unroutable, range (e.g. 192.0.2.1). The same private IP address may be assigned to many hosts as long as each is in a different network (LAN). On the other hand, on the public network, Internet, each hosts is identified by a uinique address from the publically routable range (e.g. 8.8.8.8).

Ideally and initially, it was imagined that each host has a publically unique addess, but it was discovered that the number of  IPv4 addresses initially allocated wasn't sufficient, the problem which should be solved using a far more bigger range of IPv6 addresses.

An IP address is a numerical identifier associated with a host on the network that uses the Internet Protocol (IP) for communication.
