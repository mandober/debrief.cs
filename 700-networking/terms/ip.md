# IP

**IP** is an abbreviation for **Internet Protocol**, which is the communications protocol that provides means of identification and services for locating the computers on networks, and for routing traffic across the Internet. This is the broader sense of the IP acronym.

Another, more narrow sens, but frequently used just as well, is to mean an **IP address**. Depending on a setting (and the phrasing) this may be its primary meaning.

Without qualification, IP is too underspecified, whether a protocol or an adress is meant. This is especially true today when both versions are used simoultaneously on the Internet. Besides the obvious difference in addresses, there are many bigger or smaller differences between the component protocols of the IP protocol suite.

In Internet networking, a private network is a computer network that uses a private address space of IP addresses. These addresses are commonly used for local area networks (LANs) in residential, office, and enterprise environments. Both the IPv4 and the IPv6 specifications define private IP address ranges.
