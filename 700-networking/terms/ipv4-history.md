# History of IPv4

https://ipv4marketgroup.com/a-brief-history-of-ipv4/

Late 1960s   
ARPANET project began in the Pentagon.

1969    
ARPANET developed packet switching. What would follow from these experiments was the development of the initial protocols which would define the Internet, including TCP/IP, packet switching, and email developments.

1973
TCP v1 was designed by Robert Elliot Kahn and Vinton Cerf.

1977
Jon Postel, an American computer scientist and editor of the RFC, changed the TCP protocol to TCP/IP and split TCP and IP into two distinct operating layers.

1978 TCP v3 as the split of TCP and IP into distinct layers.

1980
First formal standard (i.e. public version) of IP was version 4 (IPv4) created in 1980 as TCP/IP v4 and defined in RFC 760.

1981
IPv4 was described in IETF publication RFC 791, replacing the earlier definition in RFC 760.

1982
US Department of Defense declared TCP/IP as the standard for all military computer networking.

1983
Domain Name System (DNS) was defined in RFC 882, making navigating Internet easier.

1984
RFC 920 defines a series of top-level domains (TLD), like .com, .gov, .edu, and others.

1988
Jon Postel established and founded IANA. The term "IANA" is first referred to in RFC 1083. Postel was named Deputy Internet Architect and RFC Editor.

1989
Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, which was essentially the standard for URLs, HTTP, and HTML.

1991
The High Performance Computing and Communications Act passed in the US under Senator Albert Gore through senate bill S.272. One of the key activities of the bill was to give responsibility to the National Science Foundation (NSF) to, among other things, provide networking infrastructure support for science and engineering disciplines.

1992
The RIPE (Réseaux IP Européens) NCC was formally established to control IPv4 address distribution.

1993
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) introduced to slow the growth of routing tables and help mitigate IPv4 address exhaustion. The original specification in RFC 1519 was later replaced by RFC 4632.

1993
APNIC (Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre) was formed to allocate address space in the Asia-Pacific region.

1993
The National Science Foundation (NSF) took responsibility for non-military domain name registration. They awarded a five-year agreement to Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI) to handle this task. At the time there were only 7,500 domain names.

1994
The first RFC (RFC 1631) describing NAT. NAT translates private addresses to publically routable addresses.

1995
Domain name registration was mostly for commercial doamin .com; NSF authorized NSI to charge a fee for new domain names.

1997
ARIN (American Registry for Internet Numbers) was formed as a nonprofit corporation to provide IP registration and allocation in North America.

1998
IETF initiated the design and development of IPv6 as early as 1994 with a formal description in 1995 under RFC 1883. The first specification was published in 1998 in RFC 2460, which was later superseded by RFC 8200 which is the latest specification.

1998
The design of IPv5 as a Stream Protocol failed and was never announced publicly.

1998
ICANN incorporated as a nonprofit organization. Part of their service is to oversee domain name registration and the global registries.

2002
LACNIC was established, providing management of internet number resources to 33 territories in Latin America and the Caribbean.

2004
AFRINIC was incorporated as the internet registry for Africa.

2005
Early Registration Transfer Project (ERX) was implemented to transfer internet resource records from ARIN to the RIR in which they were used.

2011
The primary address pool of the Internet, managed by IANA, was exhausted when the last 5 blocks were allocated to the RIRs.

2011
APNIC was the first RIR to exhaust its regional address pool, except for a small amount of address space reserved for the transition to IPv6.

2011
The first commercial transfer of IPv4 addresses took place between Nortel and Microsoft. This transfer was managed by Sandra Brown, who was the Director of Engineering at Nortel at the time.

2011
IPv4 Market Group, LLC was incorporated.

2011
APNIC was the first RIR to implement an Inter-RIR Transfer Policy.

2012
ARIN implemented its Inter-RIR Transfer Policy.

2012
RIPE exhausted the last IPv4 blocks from its available pool of addresses.

2012
Just over 10 million IPv4 addresses had been transferred through the RIRs (cumulative since 2009).

2012
The first ARIN to APNIC IPv4 Inter-RIR transfer was processed.

2014
LACNIC announced its service region was considered exhausted after reaching one /10 block of remaining IPv4 addresses.

2014
The average price of a /16 block was approximately $5 per IP.

2014
About 37.7 million IPv4 addresses had been transferred through the RIRs (cumulative since 2009).

2015
Native IPv6 utilization hit approximately 5% as measured by connectivity among Google users.

2015
ARIN ran out of its free pool of IPv4 addresses.

2015
RIPE implemented its Inter-RIR Transfer Policy for internet resources authored by Sandra Brown of IPv4 Market Group.

2015
About 90.4 million IPv4 addresses had been transferred through the RIRs (cumulative since 2009).

2017
The average price of a /16 block was approximately $10 per IP.

2017
About 190.4 million IPv4 addresses had been transferred through the RIRs (cumulative since 2009).

2018
Native IPv6 utilization hit 20%.

2018
The average price of a /16 block was approximately $15 per IP.
