# IPv6 address

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6

- IPv6 address has 128 bits (four times the IPv4's 32 bits)
- 128 = 2∙64 = 4∙32 = 8∙16
  128 is divisible by 2⁰, 2¹, 2², 2³, 2⁴, 2⁵, 2⁶, 2⁷
  128 is divisible by 1,  2,  4,  8,  16, 32, 64, 128
- group of 8 hextets separated by colons
- hextet is a group of 16 bits
- hextets are referenced from left (0) to right (7), 0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7
- 4 bits is a nibble (one hex digit), so each hextet takes 4 hex digits, 4x4
- IPv4 address (32 bits) formatted like that, ffed:cbba
  would only take 2 groups of hextets, compared to 8 groups
- IPv6 addresses - concrete
  - `::` unspecified address
  - `::1` loopback (local host) address
- IPv6 address range, __2¹²⁸__
  - `0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000` min address
  - `ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff` max address
