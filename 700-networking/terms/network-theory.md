**Network theory** is the study of graphs as a representation of either symmetric relations or asymmetric relations between discrete objects. In computer science and network science, network theory is a part of *graph theory*: a network can be defined as a graph in which nodes and edges have properties (identifiers and other attributes).

Applications of network theory include logistical networks, the World Wide Web, Internet, gene regulatory networks, metabolic networks, social networks,epistemological networks, etc.
