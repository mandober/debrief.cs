# Network topology

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology

Network topology is a particular arrangement of network nodes. Network topology can be used to define or describe the arrangement of various types of telecommunication networks, including command and control radio networks, industrial fieldbusses and computer networks.

Network topology is the topological structure of a network in terms of graph theory so that hosts are modeled as vertices and the links between the hosts are modeled as edges in a graph.

Network topology has a physical and logical view:
* *physical topology* is the physical placement of various network components 
* *logical topology* illustrates the flow of data within a network

Distances between nodes, physical interconnections, transmission rates, or signal types may differ between two different networks, yet their logical topologies may be identical. A network's physical topology is a particular concern of the physical layer of the *OSI model*.

Examples of network topologies are found in a LAN where any given node has one or more physical links to other network hosts; graphically mapping these links results in a geometric shape that can be used to describe the physical topology of the network. A wide variety of physical topologies have been used in LANs, including ring, bus, mesh and star. Conversely, mapping the data flow between the components determines the logical topology of the network. In comparison, Controller Area Networks, common in vehicles, are primarily distributed control system networks of one or more controllers interconnected with sensors and actuators over, invariably, a physical bus topology.
