# General network types

## Telecommunications network
A telecommunications network is a group of nodes interconnected by telecommunications links used to exchange messages between the nodes. The links may use a variety of technologies based on the methodologies of circuit switching, message switching, or packet switching, to pass messages and signals.

## Computer network
A computer network is a set of devices that share resources provided by the network hosts. The communication between different devices on a newtwork is achieved through the use of a common set of protocols over digital interconnections. These interconnections are made up of telecommunication network technologies, based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods arranged in various network topologies.

## Neural network
A neural network is either a *biological neural network* of biological neurons, or, in a modern sense, an *artificial neural network* modeled after a biological network of neurons and used for solving various CS problems, developing and working with the problems and issues related to artificial intelligence, and especially as a component of (deep) learning algorithms. The connections of a biological neuron are modeled as a weighted graph in artificial neural networks - positive weights represent excitations, while negative values represent inhibitions.

## Bayesian network
A Bayesian network (belief network, decision network) is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph. Bayesian networks are ideal for taking an event that occurred and predicting the likelihood that any one of several possible known causes was the contributing factor.

## Ecological network
An ecological network is a representation of the biotic interactions in an ecosystem, in which species, represented by nodes, are connected by pairwise interactions, represented by edges in a graph. Ecological networks are used to describe and compare the structures of real ecosystems, while network models are used to investigate the effects of network structure on properties such as ecosystem stability.

## Electrical network
An electrical network is an interconnection of electrical components (inductors, batteries, resistors, capacitors, transistors), consisting of electrical elements (voltage sources, current sources, resistances, inductances, capacitances). An electrical circuit is a closed electrical network that gives a return path for the current.

## Gene regulatory network
A gene regulatory network (GRN) is a collection of molecular regulators that interact with each other and with other substances in the cell to govern the gene expression levels of mRNA and proteins which, in turn, determine the function of the cell. GRN also plays a central role in morphogenesis, the creation of body structures, which in turn is central to evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo).

## Project network
A project network diagram is a graph that displays the order in which a project's activities are to be completed. Derived from the work breakdown structure, the terminal elements of a project are organized sequentially based on the relationship among them. It is typically drawn from left to right to reflect project chronology.

## Workflow
A workflow consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of activity, enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information. It can be depicted as a sequence of operations, the work of a person or group, the work of an organization of staff, or one or more simple or complex mechanisms.

## Value network
A value network is a graphical illustration of social and technical resources and their utilization within an organization. The nodes in a value network represent people or, more abstractly, roles. The nodes are connected by interactions that represent deliverables. These deliverables can be objects, knowledge or money. Value networks record interdependence.

## Social network
A social network is a social structure made up of a set of social actors (such as individuals or organizations), sets of dyadic ties, and other social interactions between actors. The social network perspective provides a set of methods for analyzing the structure of whole social entities as well as a variety of theories explaining the patterns observed in these structures. The study of these structures uses social network analysis to identify local and global patterns, locate influential entities, and examine network dynamics.

## Spin network
In physics, a spin network is a type of diagram which can be used to represent states and interactions between particles and fields in quantum mechanics. From a mathematical perspective, the diagrams are a concise way to represent multilinear functions and functions between representations of matrix groups. The diagrammatic notation often simplifies calculation because simple diagrams may be used to represent complicated functions.
