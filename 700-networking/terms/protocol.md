A **communication protocol** is a system of rules that allows two or more entities of a *communications system* to *transmit information* via any variation of a *physical quantity*.

A protocol defines
- rules
- syntax
- semantics
- synchronization of communication
- possible error recovery methods

Protocols may be implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of both.

Communicating systems use well-defined formats for exchanging various messages. Each message has an exact meaning intended to elicit a response from a range of possible responses predetermined for that particular situation. 

The specified behavior is typically independent of how it is to be implemented. Communication protocols have to be agreed upon by the parties involved. To reach an agreement, a protocol may be developed into a *technical standard*.

A programming language describes the same for computations, so there is a close analogy between protocols and programming languages: protocols are to communication what programming languages are to computations.

>An alternate formulation states that protocols are to communication what algorithms are to computation.

Multiple protocols often describe different aspects of a single communication.

A group of protocols designed to work together is known as a **protocol suite**; when implemented in software they are a **protocol stack**.

Internet communication protocols are published by the IETF. The IEEE handles wired and wireless networking and the ISO handles other types. The ITU-T handles telecommunications protocols and formats for the PSTN. As the PSTN and Internet converge, the standards often do so as well.
