The Request For Comments (RFC) are a collection of documents about various topics of the Internet, containing protocol specifications and alike.

It is important to understand that not all RFC documents are protocol specifications (RFC 1796 - "Not All RFCs are Standards").

The main categories are:
- Informational
- Proposed Standard
- Draft Standard
- Internet Drafts
- Standard
- Experimental
- Best Current Practice
- For Your Information

RFC documents may also extend or update a given other RFC document, or make it obsolete. There are even April 1st jokes, which can easily be recognized by the date of publication and the often odd title and abstract.

You will find all RFC documents at the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC repository:

https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/

An useful address is The RFC Editor where you can search for specific keywords in order to find relevant RFC documents (and even Internet Drafts, which are drafted potential RFC documents):

RFC's are typically referenced by their number, so you might see something like "the TCP RFC 793" or only "RFC 793" in a document.
