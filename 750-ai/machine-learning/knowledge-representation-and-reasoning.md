# Knowledge representation and reasoning

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning

**Knowledge representation and reasoning** (`KRÂ²`, KRR, KR&R) is the field of artificial intelligence (AI) dedicated to representing information about the world in a form that a computer system can use to solve complex tasks (e.g. diagnosing a medical condition, having a dialog in a natural language).

Knowledge representation incorporates findings from psychology about how humans solve problems and represent knowledge in order to design formalisms that will make complex systems easier to design and build.

Knowledge representation and reasoning also incorporates findings from logic to automate various kinds of reasoning, such as the application of rules or the relations of sets and subsets.

Examples of knowledge representation formalisms include
- semantic nets
