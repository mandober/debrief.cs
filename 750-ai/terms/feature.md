# Feature

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)

In machine learning and pattern recognition, a **feature** is an individual measurable property or characteristic of an object or phenomenon.

Choosing informative, discriminating and independent features is a crucial element in creating effective algorithms in pattern recognition, classification and regression.

In ML, features are encoded and expressed by numbers fed to a neural network to chew on, but structural features such as strings and graphs are used in syntactic pattern recognition.

The concept of a feature is related to that of explanatory variable used in statistical techniques such as linear regression.
