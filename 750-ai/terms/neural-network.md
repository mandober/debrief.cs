# Neural network

Neural networks components:
- neuron
- neuron layers
  - input layer
  - hidden layers
  - output layer
- weights
- biases
- activation function
- cost function

Neural networks phases:
- training phase
  - training data
  - samples
  - features
  - feature sets
  - labeled data
  - data batches
- testing phase
  - classification task
  - regression task
  - unlabeled data
- inference phase
  - unseen data


>The goal in training a neural network is to find weights and biases which minimize the quadratic cost function `C(w,b)`.
