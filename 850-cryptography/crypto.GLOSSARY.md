# Cryptography :: Glossary

## Alice and Bob vs Eve
In cryptography, a common scenario is when two parties (traditionally named Alice and Bob) wants to communicate securely, reasonably assured that no third party (traditionally named Eve) can eavesdrop on them.

## Eavesdropping
Eavesdropping is the act of secretly or stealthily listening on a private exchange in order to acquire (potentially valuable) information (to be abused for all kinds of mischievous actions).

## Encryption
Encryption is the process of encoding information in a way that (ideally) only authorized parties can decode. It converts the original representation of the information called *plaintext* into the encoded version called *cyphertext*. Encryption, by itself, does not prevent interference, but scrambles the message so the interceptor (presummably) cannot read it.

- encrypt: plaintext → cyphertext
- decrypt: cyphertext → plaintext
- decrypt (encrypt msg) == msg
