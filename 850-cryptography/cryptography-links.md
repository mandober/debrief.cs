## Cryptographic nonce
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce
A nonce is an arbitrary number that can be used just once in a cryptographic communication. It is often a random or pseudo-random number issued in an authentication protocol to ensure that each communication session is unique, and therefore that old communications cannot be reused in replay attacks. Nonces can also be useful as initialization vectors and in cryptographic hash functions.

## Secp256k1
secp256k1 is an elliptic curve used primarily in the context of cryptographic algorithms and is most famously associated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The curve is defined by the Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group (SECG) and represents a specific instance of an elliptic curve over a finite field.

## ECDSA
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) offers a variant of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) which uses elliptic-curve cryptography.

## Edwards curves
The Edwards curves are a family of elliptic curves studied by Harold Edwards in 2007. The concept of elliptic curves over finite fields is widely used in elliptic curve cryptography. Applications of Edwards curves to cryptography were developed by Daniel J. Bernstein and Tanja Lange: they pointed out several advantages of the Edwards form in comparison to the more well known Weierstrass form.

## EdDSA
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA

In public-key cryptography, **Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)** is a digital signature scheme using a variant of Schnorr signature based on twisted Edwards curves. It is designed to be faster than existing digital signature schemes without sacrificing security. It was developed by a team including Daniel J. Bernstein, Niels Duif, Tanja Lange, Peter Schwabe, and Bo-Yin Yang. The reference implementation is public-domain software.

## Ed448
Ed448 is the EdDSA signature scheme using `SHAKE256` and `Curve448` defined in RFC 8032. It has also been approved in the final version the `FIPS 186-5` standard.

## FIPS
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards
The Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) of the United States are a set of publicly announced standards that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed for use in computer situs of non-military United States government agencies and contractors

## Curve448
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve448
In cryptography, Curve448 or Curve448-Goldilocks is an elliptic curve potentially offering 224 bits of security and designed for use with the elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement scheme.

## Curve25519
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519
In cryptography, Curve25519 is an elliptic curve used in elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) offering 128 bits of security (256-bit key size) and designed for use with the Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement scheme. It is one of the fastest curves in ECC, and is not covered by any known patents. The reference implementation is public domain software.

## ECC
Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) is an approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. ECC allows smaller keys to provide equivalent security, compared to cryptosystems based on modular exponentiation in Galois fields, such as the RSA cryptosystem and ElGamal cryptosystem.
