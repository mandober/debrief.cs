## Footnotes


[^npl]: **NPL** is a FPL with pattern matching designed by Rod Burstall and John Darlington in 1977. NPL has *list comprehension*: generators in a list were evaluated from left to right so later conditions can mention any previously bound vars. NPL eventually evolved into `Hope` but lost set comprehensions, which reappeared in later FPLs.

[^hope]: **Hope** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_(programming_language)

[^hp71b]: IEEE 854 arithmetic was first commercially implemented in the HP-71B, a calculator programmable in BASIC, made by Hewlett-Packard from 1984 to 1989, which used decimal floating point with 12 digits of significand, and an exponent range of ±499, with a 15 digit significand used for intermediate results.

[^z3]: **Z3** was the world's first working, programmable, fully automatic, digital computer. Z3 was designed by Konrad Zuse in 1938 and completed in 1941. It was built with 2600 relays, implementing a 22-bit word length that operated at a clock frequency of about 5-10 Hz. Like its predecessors, Z1 and Z2, Z3 also stored the program on an external punched tape, thus requiring no rewiring to change programs. Initial values were entered manually. Z3's floating-point arithmetic had *exception handling* implemented: "using just a few relays" the exceptional values (+∞, -∞, undefined) could be generated and passed through operations. Z3 also had a square root instruction. In 1998, it was shown that Z3 is Turing-complete, "in principle", because it lacked conditional branching (it meets the definition only by speculatively computing all possible outcomes of a calculation). The original Z3 was destroyed during the war, but a fully functioning replica was built in 1961 by Zuse, now on display at Deutsches Museum in Munich. Thanks to Z1, Z2, but mostly to Z3, Konrad Zuse is called the inventor of the computer.

[^pkul]: **Plankalkül** is the first high-level PL to be designed for a computer. It is a procedural PL intended for engineering, developed in Germany during the WWII, between 1942 and 1945, by Konrad Zuse, although he published the concept about it after the war, in 1948. A compiler for Plankalkül was built in 2000 by the Free University of Berlin. "Kalkül" is the German term for a formal system, as in Hilbert-Kalkül (the original name for the Hilbert-style deduction system), thus Plankalkül means a "planning calculus", or a formal system for planning. Plankalkül was influenced by Frege's "Begriffsschrift". It influenced Superplan by Heinz Rutishauser and ALGOL 58.

[^wordle] Wordle is a word game created by Josh Wardle. Players have 6 attempts to guess a 5-letter word. The mechanics are nearly identical to the 1955 pen-and-paper game "Jotto" and the television game show franchise "Lingo". Wordle has a single daily solution, with all players attempting to guess the same word. The game was purchased by The New York Times Company in January 2022 for an undisclosed 7-figure sum, with plans to keep it free for all players; it was moved to the company's website in Feb 2022.

[^multics]: Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service) is a time-sharing operating system begun in 1965 and used until 2000. Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL) joined with MIT Project MAC and General Electric's computer department in 1964 to create the Multics project.
https://multicians.org/unix.html

[^lzsh]: In 1964, for the Multics operating system, Louis Pouzin conceived the idea of "using commands somehow like a programming language," and coined the term shell to describe it. In a 1965 document, the shell is defined as "a common procedure called automatically by the supervisor whenever a user types in some message at his console, at a time when he has no other process in active execution under console control. This procedure acts as an interface between console messages and subroutine in the supervisor. Multics also introduced the active function, aka *shell alias*, a key concept in all later shells, defined as "a string … which is replaced by a character string return value before the command line containing it is executed. Active functions are often used … to implement command-language macros."

[^nebl]: *Nested block structures*: grouping of code into blocks, without the need to first convert it into separate, explicitly named, procedures.

[^lexs]: *Lexical scoping*: permit locally scoped variables (invisible to external code) in blocks, procedures and functions; an early example of information hiding.

[^bnnf]: John Backus developed the *Backus normal form* method of describing programming languages specifically for ALGOL 58. It was revised and expanded by Peter Naur for ALGOL 60, and at Donald Knuth's suggestion renamed to *Backus-Naur form (BNF)*.

[^parm]: *Pattern-matching*: early programming languages with pattern matching constructs include COMIT (1957), SNOBOL (1962), Refal (1968) with tree-based pattern matching, Prolog (1972), SASL (1976), NPL (1977), and KRC (1981).

[^sket]: Sketchpad (aka Robot Draftsman) is a computer program written by Ivan Sutherland in 1963 in the course of his PhD thesis, for which he received the Turing Award in 1988, and the Kyoto Prize in 2012. It pioneered HCI and is considered the ancestor of modern CAD programs, and a major breakthrough in the development of computer graphics in general. The concept of GUI was derived from Sketchpad as it was the first program ever to utilize a complete GUI; Also, the paradigm of OOP was influenced by Sketchpad. Sketchpad inspired Douglas Engelbart to design and develop oN-Line System.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad

[^moad]: NLS (oN-Line System) was a revolutionary computer collaboration system developed in the 1960s; designed by Douglas Engelbart and implemented by researchers at the Stanford, the NLS system was the first to employ the practical use of hypertext links, the mouse, raster-scan video monitors, information organized by relevance, screen windowing, presentation programs, and other modern computing concepts.
