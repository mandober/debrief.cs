Classes: *sections*, *areas*, *domains*.

* branches: <sections>
* leaves: <topics>


Step#1: mkdesc    
desc_word_set={CS, theory, practice, hierarchy, knowledge, manner, present}   
Practical hierarchy presented in a manner of theoretical knowledge.   
Hierarchical theory knowledgeably mannered as practical present.    
Theoretical manners in present practical tense.    
Aggregated CS knowledge presented in hierarchical manner.    

Step#2: mkhierarchy    

Organization starts with *Terms* page that gathers the titles (mainly titles of topics) are gathered.


- [Terms](./terms.md)
