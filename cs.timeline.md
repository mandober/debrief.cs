## Footnotes

[^wordle] Wordle is a word game created by Josh Wardle. Players have 6 attempts to guess a 5-letter word. The mechanics are nearly identical to the 1955 pen-and-paper game "Jotto" and the television game show franchise "Lingo". Wordle has a single daily solution, with all players attempting to guess the same word. The game was purchased by The New York Times Company in January 2022 for an undisclosed 7-figure sum, with plans to keep it free for all players; it was moved to the company's website in Feb 2022.

[^multics]: Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service) is a time-sharing operating system begun in 1965 and used until 2000. Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL) joined with MIT Project MAC and General Electric's computer department in 1964 to create the Multics project.
https://multicians.org/unix.html

[^lzsh]: In 1964, for the Multics operating system, Louis Pouzin conceived the idea of "using commands somehow like a programming language," and coined the term shell to describe it. In a 1965 document, the shell is defined as "a common procedure called automatically by the supervisor whenever a user types in some message at his console, at a time when he has no other process in active execution under console control. This procedure acts as an interface between console messages and subroutine in the supervisor. Multics also introduced the active function, aka *shell alias*, a key concept in all later shells, defined as "a string … which is replaced by a character string return value before the command line containing it is executed. Active functions are often used … to implement command-language macros."

[^nebl]: *Nested block structures*: grouping of code into blocks, without the need to first convert it into separate, explicitly named, procedures.

[^lexs]: *Lexical scoping*: permit locally scoped variables (invisible to external code) in blocks, procedures and functions; an early example of information hiding.

[^bnnf]: John Backus developed the *Backus normal form* method of describing programming languages specifically for ALGOL 58. It was revised and expanded by Peter Naur for ALGOL 60, and at Donald Knuth's suggestion renamed to *Backus-Naur form (BNF)*.

[^parm]: *Pattern-matching*: early programming languages with pattern matching constructs include COMIT (1957), SNOBOL (1962), Refal (1968) with tree-based pattern matching, Prolog (1972), SASL (1976), NPL (1977), and KRC (1981).

[^sket]: Sketchpad (aka Robot Draftsman) is a computer program written by Ivan Sutherland in 1963 in the course of his PhD thesis, for which he received the Turing Award in 1988, and the Kyoto Prize in 2012. It pioneered HCI and is considered the ancestor of modern CAD programs, and a major breakthrough in the development of computer graphics in general. The concept of GUI was derived from Sketchpad as it was the first program ever to utilize a complete GUI; Also, the paradigm of OOP was influenced by Sketchpad. Sketchpad inspired Douglas Engelbart to design and develop oN-Line System.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad

[^moad]: NLS (oN-Line System) was a revolutionary computer collaboration system developed in the 1960s; designed by Douglas Engelbart and implemented by researchers at the Stanford, the NLS system was the first to employ the practical use of hypertext links, the mouse, raster-scan video monitors, information organized by relevance, screen windowing, presentation programs, and other modern computing concepts.
