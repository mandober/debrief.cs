## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
A non-human entity that can solve sophisticated tasks, such as translating text, identifing diseases from radiologic images.

## Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
A non-human entity that demonstrates a broad range of problem solving, creativity and adaptability.

## Bias

1. (math) Bias, or bias term, is an intercept or offset from an origin.

2. (ethics) Prejudice or favoritism towards someone or something over others. Biases can affect data collection and interpretation, system design, user-system interaction. Forms of this type of bias include: automation bias, confirmation bias, experimenter's bias, group attribution bias, implicit bias, in-group bias, out-group homogeneity bias.

3. (statistics) Systematic error introduced by a sampling or reporting procedure. Forms of this type of bias include: coverage bias, non-response bias, participation bias, reporting bias, sampling bias, selection bias.

## Prediction bias
A value indicating how far apart the average of predictions is from the average of labels in the dataset.

## Confirmation bias
The tendency to search for, interpret, favor and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. Machine learning developers may inadvertently collect or label data in ways that influence an outcome supporting their existing beliefs. Confirmation bias is a form of *implicit bias*.

## Experimenter's bias
is a form of confirmation bias in which an experimenter continues training models until a preexisting hypothesis is confirmed.

## Implicit bias
Automatically making an association or assumption based on one's mental models and memories. Implicit bias can affect how the data is collected and classified,how ML systems are designed and developed. For example, when building a classifier to identify wedding photos, an engineer may use the presence of a white dress in a photo as a feature. However, white dresses have been customary only during certain eras and in certain cultures.

## Label
In supervised learning, the "answer" or "result" portion of an example. Each example in a labeled dataset consists of one or more features and a label. For instance, in a housing dataset, the features might include the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, and the age of the house, while the label might be the house's price. In a spam detection dataset, the features might include the subject line, the sender, and the email message itself, while the label would probably be either "spam" or "not spam."

## Labeled example
An example that contains features and a label. In supervised training, models learn from labeled examples.

## Machine learning
A program or system that builds (trains) a predictive model from input data. The system uses the learned model to make useful predictions from new (never-before-seen) data drawn from the same distribution as the one used to train the model. Machine learning also refers to the field of study concerned with these programs or systems.
