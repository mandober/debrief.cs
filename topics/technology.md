# Technology

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology

Technology is the sum of any techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation.

The term "technology", possibly translated as "science of craft", comes from the ancient Greek `τέχνη` [techne] meaning "art", "skill", and `-λογία` [-logia] composed from `λόγος` [lógos] meaning "explanation", with abstract noun suffix `-ῐ́ᾱ`; as a suffix, `-λογία` denotes a "branch of knowledge".

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the general how-to's, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of the implementation. Systems (e.g. machines) applying technology, by taking an input, changing it according to the system's use, and then producing an outcome, are referred to as *technology systems* or *technological systems*.
